<p>I found an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/opinion/24ornstein.html?ref=opinion">op-ed</a> in the NY Times that claimed that the best way to increase voter turnout was by having election day fall on a weekend. They provide a few examples but nothing too detailed. I tried pulling in some data and seeing if I could come to the same conclusion. I used two data sets: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout ">voter turn out by country</a> and <a href="http://www.electionguide.org/calendar.php ">election dates by country</a>.</p>

<p>Combining this data into one table, and ignoring the missing data:</p>

<table class="table">

<p>It does seem as if they are on to something - the average turnout for weekday election days was 76% while the average turnout for weekend election days was 84%. This wasn't a very rigorous examination and I am sure there are many more issues that factor in to the voting process but it does make intuitive sense.</p>
