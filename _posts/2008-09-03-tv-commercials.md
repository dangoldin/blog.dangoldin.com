<p>It may be my memory but it seems that TV commericals have been getting longer and longer as compared to a decade ago. It would be very interesting to see a plot of the length of the average commercial break over the past few decades - I think we'll see that the length of the average commercial break has drastically increased.</p>

<p>In addition, it seems as if there are no commerical breaks between consecutive TV shows anymore. Clearly this is a way to keep us from turning off the TV and doing something productive with our lives.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any thoughts?</p>
