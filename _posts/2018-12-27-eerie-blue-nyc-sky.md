Earlier tonight I looked out the window to notice an eerie blue-green sky over NYC. It looked like the standard alien landing in a scifi movie and was incredibly surreal. It turns out it was a [transformer explosion](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Blue-Light-Sky-Explosion-Queens-503589291.html) in Queens but for a second it really did feel as if something bizzare was happening. It makes you both appreciate and fear about the modern world - the technologies and cities we have are so complex and modern that an explosion led the night sky to glow blue for more than a minute. I didn’t even realize there was anything powerful enough to make the night sky glow that bright for that long but apparently we’re surrounded by that potential.
