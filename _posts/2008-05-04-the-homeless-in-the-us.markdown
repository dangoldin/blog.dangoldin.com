I find it absurd that the average prisoner costs $25,000 a year to keep in prison ($75,000 for death row) and yet we still have homelessness in the United States. Each one of the homeless may start committing some type of crime in order to get into prison and at least not worry about where their next meal comes from yet they are staying on the streets as free men. Isn't there something we can do to encourage good behavior instead of encouraging bad behavior?

Furthermore, a large percentage of the homeless are veterans and should not be ignored.
