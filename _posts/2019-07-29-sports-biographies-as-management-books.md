If you know me, you'd know that I am not into watching sports and view being a fan as a waste of time. I understand why some people do it but it's just not for me. At the same time, I'm a sucker for a good biography and really enjoy the biographies of coaches and players. Sports has a good balance of trying to improve as an individual while also competing for something as part of a team and sports biographies do a great job of walking that line.

These act as management advice and do it in a much more authentic way than yet another fluffy management book. Their purpose isn't to teach and instead they're written as an engaging story that provides an honest perspective instead of an over-analyzed and potentially hypothetical scenario.

Maybe I actually am into sports and but it's manifested by me reading biographies.
