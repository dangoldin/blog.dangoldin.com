I’m an efficiency fiend and love seeing my heavily used products updated with any and all functionality that make them a tad easier to use. A few weeks ago, Google Docs, one of my most heavily used applications - in fact where I’m writing this very post - made a minor change to the “Move to” functionality that created one of these small efficiency wins. Before the change, clicking the small folder icon while in a document would show a menu with the item’s current location and a “Move this item” option. Clicking that behavior would enable move mode and would require the user to navigate to the appropriate folder and then confirming the move.

<div class="right10">
  <amp-img src="{{ IMG_PATH }}gdocs-new.png" width="450" height="571" layout="responsive" alt="Old Google Docs behavior"></amp-img>

</div>

Seems simple enough but in order to move a document required clicking that icon, switching to move mode, navigating with a few clicks, and then concluding the move with another click. The new behavior defaults to move mode and allows you to move the item to a folder without opening it up so long as it’s selected in the list.

This is a trivial change but shows how seriously Google takes usability and constantly thinking about the details. Beyond that, I use this a few times a day so that time saved adds up.
