<p>We’re aware of Zynga’s purchase of Draw Something and Zynga’s emphasis on analytics and metrics to drive product features and decisions. I’m a bit late to the party but I tried brainstorming to put together  a Zyngafied version of Draw Something:<strong><br/></strong></p>

<ul class="bulleted">
    <li><span>Favor drawings that require colors that a user does not have to encourage the user to buy new colors.</span></li>

<li><span>Leverage the priming effect by picking words that will encourage users to spend more. For example using the words “gold”, “coin”, and “rich” would put users in a buying mood.</span></li>

<li><span>Charge more for the more popular color packs.</span></li>

<li><span>Include “limited edition” color and word packs.</span></li>

<li><span>Reward active users with free color packs, bombs, etc.</span></li>

</ul>

<p>I, for one, am glad that I got to play Draw Something before it turns into this money extraction machine.</p>
