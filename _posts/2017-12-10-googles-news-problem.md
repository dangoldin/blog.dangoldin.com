Last week, I wanted to get a bit more information about the vote in Alabama and have always had good success by starting with a Google search so did a simple search for "alabama vote." I saw three suggested results but the first was a link to Breitbart.

I ran the same search a few days ago and saw yet another Breitbart article.

The shocking thing is that these news results were actually less recent than the others yet still showed up in the first position.
