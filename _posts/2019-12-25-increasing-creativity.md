I’ve been writing the rough drafts of my recent posts on my phone and this shift in environment has made me more creative. Maybe it’s due to the slower typing speed, the lack of distraction, the novelty, or just self-deception but it feels as if some of my previous rough drafts have had both more interesting thoughts, analogies, and wordsmithing. For example, [comparing the poor battery life](http://dangoldin.com/2019/12/23/iphone-11-battery/) of my previous phone to checking out at a car's gas tank before a trip or titling a post "[Write mobile, edit desktop](http://dangoldin.com/2019/12/24/write-mobile-edit-desktop/)." It's impossible to know if I would have been able to do that if I were on my laptop but it really does seem as if the new environment had something to do with it.

I enjoy this new burst of creativity and am now trying to think of new ways to get this boost. A while back I [read something](https://trainingindustry.com/articles/content-development/how-the-brain-learns/) about how changing your commute creates new neural pathways since you're exercising entire new pathways. This is akin to that - breaking your routine and doing the same thing in a different way is a way to boost creativity. There are countless ways to find new ways of doing the same things and the process of thinking them up is itself a way to increase creativity.
