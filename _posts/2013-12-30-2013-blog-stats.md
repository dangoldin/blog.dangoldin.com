Now that I actually have over 100 posts for the year I can actually follow the trend and highlight the most popular ones as well as share some data from my Google Analytics account. This is the first year I’ve seriously committed to blogging and didn’t think I’d enjoy it as much as I did. I will continue to write at least twice a week in 2014 so it will be interesting to see how next year’s data compares against the data from 2013. Thanks for reading and definitely let me know if you have any topics you want me to write about.

      <p>A general overview of 2013 traffic. I'm honestly surprised by the number of visitors I've had but it's mostly come from a few posts that ended up getting signifcant traffic from Hacker News and Twitter. Note that the bounce rate dropped near the beginning of the year since I added a <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/07/tracking-adjusted-bounce-rate-in-google.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics event</a> to consider 15 seconds of being on the site as a "read" event.</p>

      <p>The obligatory top posts. One thing I discovered is that I am terribly poor at predicting which posts will be the most successful. We'll see if I get better at this in 2014. Here are the links in clickable form:
