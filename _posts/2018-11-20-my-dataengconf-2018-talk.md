On November 9th I had the privilege of speaking at DataEngConf under the “Hero Engineering” track. My talk was titled “The Highs and Lows of Building an AdTech Data Pipeline” and I covered our evolution from a dead simple, sampled approach that had nothing to do with big data to the latest version which is leveraging a variety of modern open source data technologies.

I spoke about the motivation, challenges, and lessons learned during each iteration and ended the talk with the top 3 lessons learned across the various iterations of the pipeline. If you’re interested in the details you can grab the slides as either [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XmOPgsbxoah2Pulw3eRvzjClOM5A5Dq-B2MWfot0guo/edit#slide=id.p) or as PowerPoint from the [DataEngConf site](https://www.dataengconf.com/speaker/the-highs-and-lows-of-building-an-adtech-data-pipeline
). Note that there was also a recording made but I’m still waiting for it to be processed and uploaded it to YouTube and will share that when it’s available.
