After writing my post on the code review pyramid I realized that I had many more thoughts on the highest level and wanted to dedicate a post digging into it.

The idea is that a well functioning team shares the same philosophy and all members have a good feel for where and how new code should be written.

For a data project: What happens upstream? In the API? In the UI?

Class hierarchy? How to handle null types/exceptions. Everything a language makes unclear a strong team can have a strong and shared agreement on.

The point isn’t to find the one right approach but to realize that it’s more about agreeing on an approach. The fact that engineers still debate the pros and cons of various implementations should indicate there’s no right answer and we’re better off finding something that’s right for the team.

In many ways frameworks make this decision on behalf of teams but imagine if it was thoughtfully done by the team itself.
