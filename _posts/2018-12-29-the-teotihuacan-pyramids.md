Last week I was on vacation in Mexico City and did a day trip to [Teotihuacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan), an ancient Mesoamerican city known for its pyramids. I find it inspiring being able to visit ruins from more than a thousand years ago. There’s something magical being able to set foot on a lost world with its own unique way of life that is impossible to recapture. So much time has passed between the actual living civilization and tourists exploring the ruins that it feels we’re completely different species and yet we’re still the same flesh, blood, and potential - just born at different times. It gives you some perspective knowing that what was once this huge civilization is now a tourist site.
