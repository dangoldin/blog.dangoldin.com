Augmented reality is still in its infancy but when it grows up it will change modern life. We’ll have a world of information at our fingertips and will end up with tools we can’t even imagine. A tool I’ve been pondering is an AR based adblock. Imagine a world where we’re all constantly wearing AR headsets that monitor and alter what we see. Now imagine that one of these applications is an adblocker that removes every visible ad. It won't matter whether the ad is a billboard on the street or something in a browser - it all goes through the same path through the headset and can be stripped away.

Disclosure: I work at TripleLift, an adtech company that’s better than most by focusing on higher quality, non-disruptive native ads.
