I’ve been writing two posts a week since the beginning of 2013 and at this point I have quite a few articles - some are one hit wonders, others are completely forgotten, while a select few are “evergreen” and are able to continually attract readers. With the start of 2017 I’ve seen a ton of bloggers doing a post highlighting their top posts from 2016 so I figured it would be fun to do the same. The data was all fetched using Google Analytics but there was a week long gap in early September when I deliberately broke the tracking while upgrading the blog to AMP. While I was hoping to get some increased growth in 2016 the total traffic ended up being pretty close to that 2015. A goal for 2017 is to focus more on evergreen posts with the goal being to build a larger audience with posts that are less responsive to the news and more about providing real value. And now on to the data:
