<p>I may be a bit late to the party but I was finally able to see the power of <a title="Twitter" rel="homepage" href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> this afternoon.</p>

<p>I kept on getting an "Authentication failed" message when trying to log in to AIM. A few years ago I would not know what to do except ask my friends if they were having any trouble. Right now, I went to searched for "AIM" on Twitter and discovered that other people were having the same problem. Turns out it was a systematic problem and I wasn't the only one affected. Being able to know more about this problem is a great benefit. There has been a lot of talk of the power of real time search and real time news but this was my first real glimpse into the power of Twitter.</p>

<p>My first action wasn't to search for "AIM log in problem" on Google but to search for "AIM" on Twitter. It's amazing to me that Twitter was able to replace a certain type of search. The majority of my searches will still be done on Google but it seems that for anything with a pulse - Twitter search is the way to go.</p>

<p>Twitter's character limit is a great way to take advantage of the network effect. Having a low character limit encourages a lot more users to tweet thereby making Twitter feel alive and giving everyone else more information.</p>

<p>There have been numerous ideas of Twitter being used for market research and to get an early customer response - I can imagine that happening now and it's mind blowing.</p>
