Over the past year I’ve been collecting a bunch of statistics for each of my days in the hope that I’ll have time to dig into them and discover some interesting patterns. Unfortunately I haven’t had a chance to do anything other than some simple visualizations but even these provide some insight into my 2017. This isn’t a wholehearted adoption of the quantified self movement but it’s something I am interested in and hoping to expand in 2018. A goal has always been to move beyond visualization and into actual analysis and actionable insights that can help me improve my lifestyle and behavior. I did the same set of [visualizations in 2016](/2017/01/02/year-in-review-2016/) so it's useful to compare them year over and year and see how, and if, my habits have changed.

      <amp-img src="{{ IMG_PATH }}sleep-duration-2017.png" alt="Sleep duration" width="800" height="600" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
      <p>Just under 7.5 hours of sleep per night but a bit all over the place.</p>

      <p>Daily consumption of coffee, tea, alcohol, and soda box plot. Compared to last year the numbers are pretty similar although I did manage to cut down slightly on both my alcohol and coffee consumption - something that I made a concerted effort to this year. Unfortunately the change wasn't as significant as I had wanted to and is a goal for 2018.</p>

      <p>An improvement over 2016 where I was very much into Chipotle. I still enjoy my burrito bowls but have also introduced salad to the mix.</p>
