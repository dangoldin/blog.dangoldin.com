A recent trick I’ve picked up to manage my time a bit better is to take all the adhoc tasks I have to do and scatter them into my calendar for the next few days. This allows me to actually get to working on the tasks and I can make sure none of them are forgotten. Using a calendar also forces me to think about the time I expect these tasks to take and plan around that. I’m nearly always running behind and am constantly shuffling tasks around but it’s much better than my previous system of a text file with a constantly growing list of todos. A side benefit of this approach is that I can split my day into [maker versus manager](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) chunks rather than be at the whim of meeting invites.
