Iâ€™m a big fan of applications that offer a keyboard-only experience for power users. Despite everything moving to the web and being possible to do with the mouse being able to use the keyboard is what separates the great and beloved products from mediocre ones.

Excel
IDEs
Editors of old - VIM, Emacs
