In November, I migrated my Tumblr and Wordpress blogs over to GitHub pages and have been making a few tweaks here and there. I started with the awesome <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll-Bootstrap library</a> but wanted to share the changes I’ve made. It’s all hosted on GitHub so feel free to fork it.

<ul>
<li>
    <b>Design changes</b><br/>
    <ul class="bulleted">
    <li>The version I started with didn’t have the Bootstrap responsiveness library so I added that in</li>
    <li>Since I’m using it primarily as a blog, I updated the design to emphasize the blog aspect</li>
    <li>Consolidated the pagination and social sharing widget to fit on one line</li>
    <li>Incorporated some best practices from <a href="http://www.kaikkonendesign.fi/typography/section/1">Kaikkonen's blog typography guide</a></li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    <b>Backend changes</b><br/>
    <ul class="bulleted">
    <li>Small improvements to SEO by giving ability to add keywords to each page</li>
    <li>Added Open Graph meta tags to control what’s displayed when people share the page on Facebook</li>
    <li>Made a few tweaks to the way the sitemap was being generated</li>
    </ul>
</li>
