A problem I occasionally run into is needing to generate a bunch of fake data and insert it into a database table. My usual approach has been to generate this data in Excel and then use a series of string concatenations to generate the necessary insert statements which I’d then execute in the SQL client. After doing this one too many times I decided it was time for a better, more automated approach and <a href="https://dangoldin.github.io/js-tools/#tab-sql-data">hacked one together</a> in JavaScript. It’s currently a part of my js-tools <a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/js-tools" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> and suggestions are welcome. One thing I definitely need to add is the ability to specify the range of possible values for each field rather than using a hardcoded distribution.
