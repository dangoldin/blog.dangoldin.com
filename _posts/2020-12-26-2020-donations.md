Last year I wrote a [short post](/2019/12/17/2019-donations/) highlighting my donations with the hope that they encourage others to donate. Given this year's trials and tribulations it's even more important to donate and help others if you have the means.

I continued my donations from last year and donated to the EFF, ACLU, Wikipedia, and Planned Parenthood for the [same reasons](/2019/12/17/2019-donations/) as last year. The additions this year have been a function of everything that's happened. Earlier in the I made multiple donations to various BLM charities and most recently contributed to [Fair Fight](https://fairfight.com/) to help with the Georgia election.

I don't know if we'll ever be in a world where donations aren't necessary but one can hope. Until then those of us that are privileged enough to help should help.
