Last November I gave a talk at Data Council NYC '18 titled "The Highs and Lows of Building an Adtech Data Pipeline" and finally saw that the video has been uploaded to YouTube. If you're interested in hearing a runthrough of the different iterations our data pipeline went through over the course of 6 years definitely give it a watch and leave comments and feedback. I'm not the most natural of public speakers and there were moments I spoke much quicker than I should have but hopefully having the slides on the side make it a tad more understandable.
