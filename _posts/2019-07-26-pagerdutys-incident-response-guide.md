As companies grow they need to develop their incident response processes. The risks are greater and the systems become increasingly more complicated with significantly more specialized knowledge. We're going through a process to redo our incident response process and while doing research I came across [PagerDuty's guide](https://response.pagerduty.com) which has been incredibly helpful in guiding our approach.

It's extremely thorough and goes into painstaking detail that describes everything one needs to do to build a mature incident response process. There's a slew of content around setting up the tools (using PagerDuty of course) but also around the cultural and organization pieces that need to be there to make it a success.

Redoing an incident response process is a big undertaking and the PagerDuty guide make it a lot more tractable. Even if you're happy with your current approach it's definitely worth a read just for the sheer amount of content and information.
