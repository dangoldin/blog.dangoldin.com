Both Meerkat and Periscope launched on iOS first. That doesn’t bother me despite have an Android phone. They’re running a business and it’s up to them to decide where they want to invest the time they have. What bothers me is that I’ve been using a specific username across the various services, dangoldin, and now run the risk of losing it on these newer networks. A simple fix would be to at least allow me to preregister my username without requiring an iOS device. This would also encourage me, and a lot of other Android users, to download the app when it finally does make its way to Android.

This is a first world problem but as more and more people start building their brands it’s useful to have a single name that spans across services and networks. It makes it easier for your audience to find you and lets you transfer audiences from one to another. There’s always going to be a way to login with Twitter or Facebook but I like having my networks divorced from one another with my username serving as the only link.
