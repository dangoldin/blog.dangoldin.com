While messing around with my laptop I discovered that keyboard shortcuts don’t work when they’re mixed across the built-in and an external keyboard. For example to save a file is Cmd+S but if I hit the Cmd key on the external keyboard and the S on the built-in the file is not saved. I found this surprising since I figured the implementation was rooted in software and not in hardware.

Time to dig in:
Hit a button on each and see what happens in the text editor
Capture input in an application
