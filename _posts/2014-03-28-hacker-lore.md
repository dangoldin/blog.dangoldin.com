I’ve always been interested in hacker lore and have recently started compiling a list of tech-related stories and anecdotes that I found amusing. My ideal story includes an odd, somewhat ridiculous, situation that required a bit of technical ingenuity to solve while highlighting an arcane corner case and providing some glee.

So far, I’ve only been able to recall and find two such anecdotes but will add more as I discover them. Depending on how many I gather I may put together a permament list page. If you have any to contribute let me know and I’ll add them to this post.

The two so far:

</ul>
