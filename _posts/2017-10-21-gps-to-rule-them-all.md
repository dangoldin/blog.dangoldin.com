I spent a few hours driving today and couldn’t stop but think how different driving is now compared to the pre-smartphone, pre-GPS days. You needed to plan your routes well in advance and detours were a problem since you had no way of knowing how to make it back on track.

The big realization is that without GPS none of the ridesharing apps would exist. GPS commoditizes drivers since street knowledge no longer matters. In fact I’ve never taken an Uber or Lyft where the driver wasn’t using a GPS.
