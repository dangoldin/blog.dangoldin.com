I'm currently the founder of [Twing Data](https://www.twingdata.com/) and [FastPenTests](https://www.fastpentests.com/). Twing Data helps companies get the most out of their data warehouse by analyzing every query that runs. FastPenTests offers a 24 hour penetration testing service for websites and APIs in 24 hours.

Prior to this I led the engineering team at [TripleLift](https://triplelift.com/) that was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $1.4B in 2021. Before that I cofounded [Makers Alley](http://makersalley.com/) and [Glossi](https://pando.com/2012/07/17/glossis-social-megafeed-takes-on-rebelmousevizify/). Before going down the entrepreneurial path I did a stint as a quantitative engineer and product manager at Yodle; a wall street quant at Och Ziff, and a management consultant at ZS Associates.

A few of the projects I've hacked on:

- [Yet Another Hacker News Reader](https://yahnr.dangoldin.com/)
- [Yahoo Fantasy Football stats scraper](https://github.com/dangoldin/yahoo-ffl)
- A bunch more on [GitHub](https://github.com/dangoldin/)

I also have a [resume](/data/dg_res.pdf).
