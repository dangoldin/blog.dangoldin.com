Besides blogging I’m a big reader and normally get through read a book a week. Most of my reading is done on Kindle and whenever I come across any interesting passage or quote I highlight them. Then every few weeks I go through my highlights, add them to a single [file](https://github.com/dangoldin/quotes/blob/master/quotes.txt), and dump it into a GitHub [repo](https://github.com/dangoldin/quotes). Earlier today I decided to do something fun and wrote a simple [endpoint](https://bots.dangoldin.com/quoteme) to fetch a random quote. The majority of my reading is nonfiction and this is reflected in my quotes. In addition, I’m a sucker for biographies and computer history books so they’re an even larger share of the quotes. I also like to throw a few idioms into the mix. So if you’re ever in the mood for a random quote take a look at [https://bots.dangoldin.com/quoteme](https://bots.dangoldin.com/quoteme).
