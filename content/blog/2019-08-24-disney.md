Yesterday the internet blew up after Disney's announcement of a new series, [The Mandalorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian), that would be available as a part of their new streaming service, Disney+. I watched the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOC8E8z_ifw) and as expected it hit all the right Star Wars nostalgia points. The show itself wasn't what stood out. Instead it was the closing scene where Disney highlights what Disney+ includes: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic.

People following the "streaming wars" know how many properties Disney owns but this is a shot to everyone else that Disney owns a ton of content. It's an incredibly strong move and makes me more and more bullish about Disney and the Disney+ offering. I'd be shocked if they don't quickly rise to the top ranking. It's a bit difficult to pull up to date subscriber numbers by service but I found some data from April 2018 indicating that HBO is ahead of Netflix which is ahead of Amazon Prime. I don't know what the latest numbers are but I can easily imagine Disney quickly competing with the top 3. I wouldn't even be surprised if they surpass every other streaming service - they have content that runs the gamut and the price is more than fair. I currently own a small amount of Disney stock but to put my money where my mouth is I plan on purchasing more this week.
