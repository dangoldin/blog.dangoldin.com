title: Get Google Group membership using Calendar

I'm not sure where I discovered this tip but I'll often want to know the members of a Google group. The ways to get this are constantly changing - from double clicking the group within the Gmail compose window for a summary modal to going deep into the Groups UI. Somewhere in between is the group view provided by Google Calendar. I'm often in there and it turns out to be a pretty quick way of getting the list of all the users in a group without having to have anything open in another tab. One of the best parts is that it gives you the ability to expand and dedup group memberships which is great for dealing with nested groups - such as sub teams.

To get the membership you can simply add a group alias to the calendar invite, expand the list, and then hit the expand icon to get the flattened and deduped list.
