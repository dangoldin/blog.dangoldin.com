Bill Gates once said "Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years" and it's a good assessment of my decade. It was my first decade as an adult and it was very much about finding my footing, both professionally and personally. My first few years out of college were trying to figure things out and understand who I am and what I enjoy doing. I started the decade working as a quant, to attempting two startups, to joining a quickly growing [startup](https://triplelift.com/) that I've been at for the past 6 years.

It's been an incredibly busy 10 years and I look forward to the next 10. Rather than breadth these will be focused on depth and I hope to write another short blog post then.
