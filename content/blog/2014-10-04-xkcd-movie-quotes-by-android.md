title: XKCD movie quotes by Android
---

Earlier this week XKCD featured a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1427/" target="_blank">comic</a> where oft-quoted movie quotes are autocompleted by iOS keyboard predictions. I decided to do replicate the exercise using Android and Swype. Some are similar while others are completely different. I suspect a big part of the difference is that Swype uses my history when offering the suggestions and since Iâ€™ve been travelling recently many of them tend to be airport related.
