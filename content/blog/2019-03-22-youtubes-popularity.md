I know YouTube is huge but it’s amazing how small of a role it plays in my life. The statistics make it seem as if nearly every person online is addicted to YouTube and yet I barely use it. The extent of my YouTube experience is watching how-to videos whenever I need to do something around the house.

The most recent time I watched YouTube was a directed search for a how to video on how to disassemble and unclog a bathtub drain. Beyond that I can’t recall the last time I watched a YouTube video. Every once in a while I will get nostalgic and watch some classic video game videos but other than that my YouTube watching is minimal.

I know that YouTube is extremely popular but I have a difficult time reconciling that given my usage. It’s yet another example of how my attitude towards the modern digital world seems at odds with the rest of the world.
