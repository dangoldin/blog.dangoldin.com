I just hacked together a quick app to help download Instagram photos. At first, I tried using <a href="http://instaport.me">Instaport</a> and <a href="https://openphoto.me/">OpenPhoto</a> but both of them were backed up with others trying to do the same so I decided to create my own. It's basically a really simple python web app that allows you do a quick authentication with Instagram and then lets you downloads all your images to your hard drive.

It should be pretty easy to get started by following the readme on github: <a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/instagram-download">https://github.com/dangoldin/instagram-download</a>
