Despite the fact that the Marvel news about a transgender character is not true it reinforced how significant media is to progress and growth of culture. Adults are set in their ways and are less impressionable than children. By exposing children to a more accepting world we help make it a reality. It's unfortunate that this news turned out to be false but the fact that it was even believable is a sign that we're making progress. I have no doubt that it will happen and it's only a question of when.

I used to be a cynic when it comes to media and its consumption and yet I can't help but feel it's actually what improves society. It may feel that the media these days is playing to our worst desires and yet I can't help but feel optimistic.
