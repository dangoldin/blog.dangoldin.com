  They're clearly spam and I don't understand how they add value to anyone.

Ever since I’ve started blogging I’ve been getting around one spam blog comment a week. <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a> does a nearly perfect job of flagging them so I don’t understand the motivation behind it. They’re obviously spam and my readers are suave enough to never click on any of the links. There’s also little, possibly none, SEO value since they’re all loaded asynchronously and every link has a rel=”nofollow” property. And if the goal is to spark a discussiong and raise awareness they're so poorly worded that no reader will take them seriously. The only thing I can think of is that these companies pay a third party service to grace tangentially related blogs with content on their behalf and these third party services go the cheapest possible route in both effort and quality.
