I had a bit of a blogging break this year but the pull of tradition is too strong. For the sixth year in a row I updated my Yahoo fantasy football stats scraper to pull Yahoo's projected fantasy stats for the upcoming season. The only change this year was the addition of a "O Rank" column which was simple to implement so I have no excuse for pushing this off till the last minute. Hopefully this shames me into writing more.

As usual both the [code](https://github.com/dangoldin/yahoo-ffl) and [data](https://github.com/dangoldin/yahoo-ffl/blob/master/stats-2022.csv) are up on GitHub. Pull requests welcome.
