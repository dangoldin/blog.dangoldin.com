Inspired by yesterday’s post I decided to compile a list the memories I’ve had growing up with computers - hopefully they spark others. I tried to keep these in chronological order but I made some mistakes.

- The increase in the number of colors on a monitor and the various *GAs (CGA, EGA, VGA, XVGA)
- Booting of one floppy disk and then running programs off another
- Having both a 3.5 inch and a 5.25 inch floppy disk drives
- Playing Prince of Persia for the first time
- Using Norton Commander rather than the DOS command line
- Shareware and the tons of paper catalogues selling games by mail
- Upgrading to a 486 DX2
- Installing Windows 3.1 from a ton of floppy disks
- The wonderful blue screen of death
- Getting a second phone line in order to use dial up
- Getting AOL instant messenger and my first screenname
- Upgrading to a 56k modem
- Using NetZero as an ISP
- Hosting my first website at Geocities (wish I knew where it was and could dig it up)
- Lycos and AltaVista
- Finally getting a cable modem
- Learning Pascal and C++ in high school
- Warcraft 2, Starcraft, Diablo, Total Annihilation, Shattered Galaxy and LAN parties
- Using Google for the first time
- Signing up for the Gmail beta
- Getting my first smartphone, a Motorola Droid I

Since then, I’ve had a ton of experiences but they feel incremental. I guess being steeped in tech for so long gives that perception.
