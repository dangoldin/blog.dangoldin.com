A brief one today.

This past week, Sandy and I have been super busy getting a new version of <a href="https://makersalley.com/" target="_blank">Makers Alley</a> out that allows you to customize and buy furniture. We’re launching with two makers that have items for sale but we’re busy adding more. <a href="https://makersalley.com/maker/withers-and-grain/" target="_blank">Withers &amp; Grain</a> specialize in using reclaimed wood from the 5 boroughs and do their own wood and metal work. <a href="https://makersalley.com/maker/mark-grattan-design-and-build/" target="_blank">Mark Grattan</a> is a furniture designer who has designed a furniture collection for Makers Alley in a geometry-inspired style. Take a look at their pages, watch their videos, and customize their pieces. If you have any feedback let me know.
