This is an annual tradition now but I just updated my old script that crawls and extracts the projected fantasy football data from Yahoo to work with the 2016-2017 season. The changes were incredibly minor: Yahoo broke the the login page into two steps and there was a minor change in the order of the columns. Both of these were trivial to implement and the code is up on [GitHub](https://github.com/dangoldin/yahoo-ffl). If all you care about is the raw data you can just download the [CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangoldin/yahoo-ffl/master/stats-2017.csv).

Every year I intend to use the data to come up with a drafting algorithm yet I’ve failed to do anything with it over the past couple of years. I’m hoping this year is different.
