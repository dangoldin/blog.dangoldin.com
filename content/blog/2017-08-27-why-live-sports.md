title: Why live sports?
---

Yesterday the world was so abuzz with the Mayweather vs McGregor boxing match that even I couldn’t escape from hearing about it. One small tidbit I discovered was that it would cost you $100 just to watch it in the comfort of your own home. And while I definitely don’t consider myself a sports fan that still feels ridiculous.

Everyone believes that the live nature of sports makes them completely different than other media and yet that doesn’t strike a chord with me. I’ve been to some live events and when you’re with a group the real time element and environment is critical. This also goes for the case where you’re a huge fan and need to know everything as soon as possible. But for the casual fan having a couple of hour delay doesn’t seem that critical. Sure you have to avoid hearing or reading about the outcome but without that knowledge the two situations seem equivalent - at least rationally, if not emotionally.
