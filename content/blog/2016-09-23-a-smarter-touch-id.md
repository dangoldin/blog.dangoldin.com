description: Apple's Touch ID is great when my fingers are dry but utterly fails when
  they're wet. It should have enough history to create a wet profile of my finger.

Apple’s Touch ID is great but one thing it doesn't handle well is wet fingers. Even if my hands are a little bit sweaty or not completely dry it's difficult to unlock the phone. Yet as soon as they’re dry the phone immediately unlocks. What’s surprising, especially given Apple's focus on delivering the perfect user experience, is that this is still a problem. I'm not familiar with the hardware behind Touch ID but even if there's some sort of warped fingerprint it should be good enough. The fact that there are a few unsuccessful attempts with the wet thumb followed by successful attempt should be enough to develop a profile for the wet version which can be used on future attempts. Modern products succeed by delivering optimized experiences; future products will need to adapt and grow along with us until they become eerily predictive.
