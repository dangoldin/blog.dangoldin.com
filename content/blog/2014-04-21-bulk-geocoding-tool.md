title: Bulk geocoding tool
---

Over the weekend I dug up an <a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/js-tools" target="_blank">old repository</a> I started to contain a running collection of <a href="https://dangoldin.github.io/js-tools/" target="_blank">JavaScript tools</a> to make my life easier. Ever since I created it it had two tools - one to convert CSV/TSV text into a bootstrap table and the other to generate a “BCG style” matrix. Earlier today I coded up another script - a quick way to geocode a list of addresses. All you have to do is enter a list of address you want geocoded, one per line, and the script will use the Google Maps API to geocode each one with the resulting latitude/longitude being written to an HTML table. If you have any other suggestions for a quick tool let me know.
