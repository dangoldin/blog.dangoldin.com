Turns out that tagging and categorizing blog posts is more difficult than I thought. I start with one set of tags but as I go through my posts I realize that my initial set of tags no longer make sense and I need to restart. The challenge is finding the set of tags that are specific enough to categorize a single post yet general enough that they can be applied to other ones. I haven’t found the perfect set of tags yet but did manage to go through and tag each of [my posts](/tags). Over time I hope to improve the tag taxonomy and update the existing posts. I’d love to hear suggestions on how to effectively organize my posts and examples of other blogs that are doing this well.
