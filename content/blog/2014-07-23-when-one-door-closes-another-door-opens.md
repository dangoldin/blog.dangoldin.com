Food trucks have taken over every city I've been to. A decade ago the best you could find was a taco truck but now food trucks run the gamut from the simple taco up to experimental vegan. Priceonomics has a <a href="http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/45352687467/food-truck-economics" target="_blank">great piece</a> on the rise of the food truck as well as a fascinating look at the economics of the food truck industry. If you haven't read it yet definitely check it out.

The summary is that the decline of the housing market in 2008 led to a drop in construction which caused many food trucks to sold at a discount. These food trucks were then bought by aspiring chefs who wanted a low risk way to start a restaurant. The cheap trucks gave chefs a way to experiment with varying cuisines and locations without incurring the massive costs of starting a restaurant.

This is a perfect example of how capitalism should work. Industries that are no longer profitable make way for new ones that leverage existing infrastructure. In the future these food trucks will transform into miniature carriers that will carry drones that will deliver food throughout cities. When one door closes, another door opens.
