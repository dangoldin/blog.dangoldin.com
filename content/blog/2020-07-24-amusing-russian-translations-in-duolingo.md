title: Amusing Russian translations in Duolingo
---

Many are using the lockdown as a way to improve themselves. I grew up a native Russian speaker which has unfortunately eroded over the years and I've spent the past few months improving my Russian through Duolingo. It's a surprisingly effective app and has enough gamification to keep me going. My approach has been to just take the tests to skip out of lessons until I master every lesson. It started off easy but I'm now failing to advance about 20% of the time. Some of these are very much due to Russian specific issues - namely the fact that very often you can change the order of words in Russian without affecting the translation which Duolingo doesn't seem to be able to handle well. Yet to keep things fun I've been screenshotting amusing translations and thought I'd share the best ones here.
