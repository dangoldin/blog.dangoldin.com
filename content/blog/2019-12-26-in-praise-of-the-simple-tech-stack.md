title: In praise of the simple tech stack

These days it's so easy to feel as if you're falling behind the tech curve. There's a new tool or technology being released every day and there's a strong temptation to try everything lest you fall behind.

That's why it was so refreshing to come across "[The boring technology behind a one-person Internet company](https://broadcast.listennotes.com/the-boring-technology-behind-listen-notes-56697c2e347b)." It's a post written by [Wenbin Fang](https://broadcast.listennotes.com/@wenbinf), the founder and CEO of [ListenNotes.com](https://www.listennotes.com/), and is exactly what you think it is.

The technology is far from boring but it's straightforward and has a proven track record. The author is comfortable with it and it allows him to focus on growing the business rather than be constantly in the weeds debugging some arcane behavior. Trying new things is incredibly valuable and is the only way we end up with improvements but this post was a nice reminder that you don't need to be on the bleeding edge to build a successful product.
