I’ve been interested in the Raspberry Pi ever since I first saw it mentioned in the tech news and finally got to play with it over the past few days when my brother (thanks <a href="http://simongoldin.com/" target="_blank">Simon</a>!) lent me an extra one he had. I’ve been in need of a better media center setup ever since my DisplayPort cable stopped working so I decided to try out Raspbmc, a Raspberry Pi based media center.

I scavenged an SD card from my camera and a microUSB AC adapter from my old Droid phone which I somehow still had lying around. With those two, I was able to install Raspbmc but couldn’t get any farther without a wifi adapter. It took the wifi adapter a few days to get delivered but it worked right out of the box and I had a functional media center. Surprisingly, I didn’t need a keyboard at all and was able to run through the entire setup using SSH and a downloadable iPhone app that acts as a remote. The most time-consuming part was setting up a Samba shared folder under Mountain Lion and adding it to Raspbmc using the onscreen UI.

It works well. It solves my “must-have” problem of using my TV to play videos that are on my computer and also has a bunch of “nice-to-haves”. The two big ones are AirPlay support which allows streaming of audio and video from iOS devices and the ability to use my iPhone as a remote. Only thing left is getting an enclosure so it’s not just lying on the floor.

Here’s the setup:

<ul class="bulleted">
    <li><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> - $25 or $35 model</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833315091" target="_blank">Wifi Adapter</a> - $10 on Newegg</li>
    <li>microUSB AC Adapter - I found one but should be around $5</li>
    <li>SD Card - I had one but can find one for around $6 on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_n_1?rh=n%3A172282%2Cn%3A541966%2Cn%3A172456%2Cn%3A516866%2Cn%3A1197396%2Ck%3Asd+card+4gb&amp;keywords=sd+card+4gb&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365618369&amp;rnid=493964" target="_blank">Amazon</a></li>
    <li>HDMI Cable - $2 and up on <a href="http://www.monoprice.com/" target="_blank">Monoprice</a></li>
</ul>
