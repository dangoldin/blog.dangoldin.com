title: Video games of my youth
---

Lately I've been feeling nostalgic about the video games from my youth and spent some time browsing YouTube and trying to remember my favorites. I was exclusively a PC gamer except for one month period where I had a Sega Genesis - which my parents got for me as a reward for reading a 1000 pages of Russian. Unfortunately (or fortunately), our "deal" did not include any additional games so the system was returned within a month of me getting it. I have a ton more memories from the mid-90s but these stood out as my earliest memories. I'm pretty sure I didn't beat any of them but it was a wonderful time playing these as a kid in the early 90s.

      <p><strong>Golden Axe</strong>. I loved the hack and slash here and remember being awed by the graphics. This also had a great multiplayer component that I spent hours on with my brother.</p>

      <p><strong>Jill of the Jungle</strong>. I came across this game in a shareware (remember those?) magazine and after trying the demo really wanted the actual game. I don't recall whether I saved up to buy it or whether it was a gift but was a big fan of the side-scroller style action/adventure game.</p>

      <p><strong>Commander Keen</strong>. Similar to the above this was a fun side-scroller that was just fun to play and explore. I don't recall how I got into this but do remember eagerly trying to get the sequels.</p>

      <p><strong>Wolfenstein 3D/Doom</strong>. I grouped these together since they were both first person shooters and I jumped from one to the other as soon as it came out. I was arguably way too young to play either one but had a blast. I also recall mods of the game but don't remember the actual details.</p>

      <p><strong>Impossible Mission</strong>. I spent a lot of time on this game. I don't even think I knew what the goal was other than to run around and explore.</p>

      <p><strong>Alley Cat</strong>. I have no idea why I played this game as much as I did. It had a series of mini-levels and there were definitely favorites and levels I hated.</p>

      <p><strong>Alone in the Dark</strong>. Another game I should have probably not been playing. I don't recall liking this too much since it felt slow and I didn't know what I was doing but I do have memories.</p>

      <p><strong>Prince of Persia/Karateka</strong>. No list could be complete without this. This game was way too hard for me until I found cheat codes.</p>

      <p><strong>Airborne Ranger</strong>. This brings back memories. It was so fun running around and exploring the map trying to complete various objectives.</p>

      <p><strong>Star Goose</strong>. Damn this game was difficult. The graphics blew me away but what an incredibly difficult game.</p>

      <p><strong>Budokan</strong>. The graphics were great and what's not to liking about a karate fighting game? I vaguely recall the nunchucks being the easiest to use.</p>

      <p><strong>Lakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs</strong>. I knew nothing about basketball yet enjoyed playing the game - probably for the graphics. My most significant memory here is having to type in words from the manual in order to bypass the theft protection.</p>
