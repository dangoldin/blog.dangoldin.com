title: Slides from my talk at DataEngConf
---

I had the privilege of giving a talk today at DataEngConf. Unfortunately the talk was not recorded but you can grab the slides [here]({{DATA_PATH }}/DataEngCof_NYC_Data_Startups_Dan_Goldin-Scaling-a-Data-Pipeline-Mystery-to-Mastery.pdf). The theme was going over the evolution of the TripleLift data pipeline from the early days where we were sampling events on the client side to the current iteration of a fully fleshed out Lambda architecture. Take a look at the slides and if you have any questions Iâ€™d be glad to answer them in the comments.
