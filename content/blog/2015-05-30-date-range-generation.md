I finally had the chance to go back and add <a href="https://dangoldin.github.io/js-tools/#tab-date-generation" target="_blank">another quick tool</a> to my JavaScript arsenal. This one lets you specify a start date, an end date, a step size and interval, along with a desired date format and it will generate the dates in between. This is a surprisingly common activity for me. Every time I need to split a query into multiple date ranges or come up with a series of arguments for various jobs I end up using Excel to come up with the appropriate date ranges. By having it available via the web it makes it a lot easier to generate exactly what I need as well as provides the flexibility to keep on improving. If there are any improvements youâ€™d like to see or if anything is unclear definitely let me know.
