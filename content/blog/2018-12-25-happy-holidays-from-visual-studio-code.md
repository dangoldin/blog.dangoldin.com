Visual Studio Code has been my go-to editor since the beginning of 2017 and I’m a huge fan. They reinforced my belief with a little Easter egg earlier today to celebrate Christmas. The settings icon in the bottom right corner got a special Santa hat and clicking on it gives you an additional menu option labeled “Happy Holidays!” which gives you a friendly holiday message along with some falling snow.

I love it when products don’t take themselves too seriously and add a little bit of fun. It’s refreshing to see something done just because it’s fun without requiring a fully fleshed out business case. The best products realize they will be used by humans and Easter eggs reinforce that.
