I enjoy [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com) and often find myself coming across an interesting article on the site. Yesterday I got a pleasant surprise from an old coworker who sent me an [article](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-create-a-slack-bot-that-messages-all-members-of-a-workspace-in-8-minutes-32a5b52838be) about building a Slack bot that mentioned of one of my [blog posts](http://dangoldin.com/2017/06/30/send-private-messages-to-all-members-of-a-slack-channel/). A few months earlier the author and I had a conversation in the comment thread and I’m glad she found the conversation useful enough to write a much more thorough post.

I don’t write write for publicity and genuinely enjoy the process of clarifying my thoughts through writing so it’s definitely rewarding to see a link back to my blog. It feels good knowing that my blog is interesting enough to warrant a link and it’s definitely appreciated.

Since I only discovered this backlink accidentally I got curious about how many others I missed over the years and decided to dig in. I found a free [backlink checker](https://lxrmarketplace.com/seo-inbound-link-checker-tool.html) and after searching for my domain name discovered that there are actually quite a few linkbacks. Some are list aggregators - such as [top books](http://www.largeheartedboy.com/blog/archive/2016/11/online_best_of_73.html) or [quantified self visualizations](http://quantifiedself.com/2015/01/represent-year-numbers/) while others are more interesting - there are quite a few links to a 5 year old [blog post](http://dangoldin.com/2013/04/12/why-dont-cellphones-have-a-dialtone/) about the lack of a dial tone in cell phones as well as a link from [CityLab](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/06/in-new-york-city-bikeshare-is-faster-than-cabs-when-it-matters-most/530469/) for a post about Citi Bike trip planning.

It turns out some of my posts and projects actually do make their way past my blog. It’s not much but it’s definitely cool.
