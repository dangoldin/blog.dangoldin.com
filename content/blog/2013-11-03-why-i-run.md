title: Why I run
---

In honor of today’s NYC marathon, I finally finished up this post that’s been sitting in my drafts folder the past few weeks.

I’ve never been into running until the beginning of this year when I decided to run 1000 miles. This led to me to three half marathons and is actually making me consider doing a full one. It’s amazing where a habit and a bit of effort can take you. Initially, I ran just to hit my goal and only signed up for races in order to keep myself motivated and on track. Now, it’s become significantly more than that. There are so many things outside my control yet running is solely about my effort and willpower. If I fail it’s my defeat and if I succeed it’s my victory. I can easily skip a run on a cold, rainy morning and yet I know I’m just deceiving myself and I’ll have to make it up later. Running is one of the simplest things to do and that’s a huge appeal. The human bodies have evolved to run and kids start running as soon as they learn to walk. As our world becomes increasingly complex it’s nice being able to escape with a quick run. Whether it’s running or something else, it’s important to have an outlet that rewards us based on our efforts. The further away this activity is from our day jobs the better.
