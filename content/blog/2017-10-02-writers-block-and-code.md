title: Writer's block and code
---

The past few months I’ve been finding it more difficult to stick to my two post a week schedule. As I write this I’m 5 posts behind that I need to make up for by the end of the week in order to stick with my commitment. I suspect it’s common for true writers to have periods of writer’s block but I’m a casual blogger so it shouldn’t be that hard for me to just sit down and knock something out. I’ve also developed the habit, or maybe even the skill, of going through my day and being able to identify topics and themes that would be interesting to blog out. I have close to 150 of these ideas and yet lately I’ve found it difficult to even start.

I don’t know why but my suspicion is that it’s related to the fact that lately I’ve been much more focused on managing and haven’t had a chance to code as much. Coding gives me that creative recharge that I can use to write. Without that energy writing is less of a pleasure and feels like more of a chore. Over the next few weeks I’m going to block of some coding time with the hope that it helps me get my writing back.
