These days I rarely code during work since there’s other work to be done but I miss it. Lately I’ve started working on some [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) problems. They send me a problem a day and nearly every time I’ve been able to knock out a solution in a few minutes. It feels as if I’m keeping my skills sharp and gives me that quick win. Every once in a while I’ll pick up an old project to hack on but that’s a very different style of coding. That’s more focused on understanding modern frameworks and web development while HackerRank problems are entirely standalone and tend to be logic based that often depend on finding the insight before coding up the solution:: they’re basically a poor man’s version of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). I know most people use them to prepare for interviews but I like using them for the challenge and the win.
