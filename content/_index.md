Currently the VP of engineering at TripleLift. Before that I cofounded Makers Alley and Pressi. Before going down the entrepreneurial path I did a stint as a quantitative engineer and product manager at Yodle; a wall street quant at Och Ziff, and a management consultant at ZS Associates.

Here are some side projects Iâ€™ve been hacking on:

- Yet Another Hacker News Reader
- Yahoo Fantasy Football stats scraper
- A bunch more on Github

I also have a resume!!
