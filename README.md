This blog went through a bunch of iterations starting with Jekyll-Bootstrap, to a theme that was inspired by [Simon HÃ¸rup Eskildsen](http://sirupsen.com/), to the current setup where it's entirely written in [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/).

Intall required gems:

```
gem install bundler
gem install jekyll
gem install nokogiri
gem install nokogiri
gem install fastimage
gem install jekyll-redirect-from
gem install jekyll-sitemap
gem install jekyll-include-cache
```
