I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people that will Wikipedia anything new and came across this sentence that describes his popularity:
&amp;ldquo;Also in 1948, Music Digest estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music&amp;rdquo;
This reminded me of another celebrity from that era, Charles Lindbergh, and his popularity:</description></item><item><title>2020 donations</title><link>/2020/12/26/2020-donations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/26/2020-donations/</guid><description>Last year I wrote a short post highlighting my donations with the hope that they encourage others to donate. Given this year&amp;rsquo;s trials and tribulations it&amp;rsquo;s even more important to donate and help others if you have the means.
I continued my donations from last year and donated to the EFF, ACLU, Wikipedia, and Planned Parenthood for the same reasons as last year. The additions this year have been a function of everything that&amp;rsquo;s happened.</description></item><item><title>Gasoline</title><link>/2020/10/21/gasoline/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/10/21/gasoline/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a believer in climate change and know we need to change our habits and yet every time I drive I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of how amazing gasoline is. A gallon of a liquid is not much - we can all drink a gallon of water a day and yet a gallon of gasoline is enough to move a mutli-ton car more than 20 miles. It&amp;rsquo;s so normal that we don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate how amazing that actually is.</description></item><item><title>Apple and Mr. Burns: Indestructible</title><link>/2020/08/20/apple-and-mr.-burns-indestructible/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/08/20/apple-and-mr.-burns-indestructible/</guid><description>Apple hit a $2T market cap and yet I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think they&amp;rsquo;re in an incredibly precarious situation due to the relationship between the US and China. I find the Apple/US/China dynamic much more interesting than what&amp;rsquo;s going on with TikTok. Right now it feels as if every side wants Apple to succeed. For the US it&amp;rsquo;s a success story and a cultural export to the world. To China it&amp;rsquo;s an indicator that they can power the manufacturing, at scale, of one of the most sophisticated technical products in the world and a massive boon to their economy.</description></item><item><title>TikTok: A Prisoner's Dilemma</title><link>/2020/08/09/tiktok-a-prisoners-dilemma/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/08/09/tiktok-a-prisoners-dilemma/</guid><description>Everyone has an opinion here and I’m late but joining the fray. I fall into the ban TikTok app. I would not be doing it the way it&amp;rsquo;s currently being done but there&amp;rsquo;s a legitimate case to make that the US should adopt a tit for tat strategy with China. China prevents many US companies from competing there so why should we allow it?
There are of course arguments around us being the United States and needing to take the high road.</description></item><item><title>Black Lives Matter</title><link>/2020/06/06/black-lives-matter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/06/06/black-lives-matter/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to think of or write about anything other than the protests going on right now. I hope that everything going on is a necessary step to get the United States to accept its sordid treatment of Black people and into a more fair and equal world. The past few weeks have made race come to the foreground as a topic that must be discussed. In the past I shied away from discussing anything race related; especially coming from my privileged background and despite my intent I was worried about the language I used and concerned about being misinterpreted.</description></item><item><title>AlphaGo documentary</title><link>/2020/04/18/alphago-documentary/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/04/18/alphago-documentary/</guid><description>Spoiler: If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the documentary and want to avoid any spoilers don&amp;rsquo;t read the post. At the same time you should watch it - it&amp;rsquo;s an incredible film.
I watched the AlphaGo documentary and it left a powerful impression on me.
The accomplishment by the AlphaGo team is incredible. At the same time I felt incredibly sad watching it and became slightly depressed. It felt very much like a man vs machine battle yet the machine was a huge team of engineers with nearly unlimited resources.</description></item><item><title>Google and Apple's COVID tracking project</title><link>/2020/04/18/google-and-apples-covid-tracking-project/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/04/18/google-and-apples-covid-tracking-project/</guid><description>Google and Apple recently announced a partnership to help people anonymously see if they&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to someone with COVID. The idea itself is elegant and does a nice job balancing the functionality with the need for privacy. One of the most common takes I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in tech circles is that no one will use it due to a concern for privacy.
I think the opposite. I believe that with enough marketing this will be a massive success.</description></item><item><title>Start open sourcing government software</title><link>/2020/04/05/start-open-sourcing-government-software/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/04/05/start-open-sourcing-government-software/</guid><description>Two years ago I wrote a post describing an open source model for developing government software. The driver then was improving the user experience of government services and making them more approachable but the news this week makes this much more than a nicer UX. The state of NJ is apparently looking for COBOL programmers in order to update the unemployment system to handle the unprecedented volume. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to make a government joke but there are real people that are unable to get the services they need.</description></item><item><title>Finding the truth in a sea of misinformation</title><link>/2020/04/04/finding-the-truth-in-a-sea-of-misinformation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/04/04/finding-the-truth-in-a-sea-of-misinformation/</guid><description>Two days ago I read an interview between Ben Thompson and Zeynep Tufekci which highlighted the current state of information (and misinformation). That same day I came across an article by Will Remus on the cause of the toilet paper shortage (spoiler: it has to do with differences between the corporate and personal toilet paper supply chains). Both of these highlight how little I actually know and how valuable skeptical mindset is these days.</description></item><item><title>COVID-19</title><link>/2020/03/28/covid-19/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/03/28/covid-19/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s taken me a few weeks to write this post. Partly due to lack of motivation, partly lack of time, and partly due to my fluctuating feelings towards COVID-19.
Some days I was completely disillusioned and sad about the modern state of the world. It seems to be spreading unconstrained despite the more than one hundred years of scientific progress we&amp;rsquo;ve had since 1918. Politicians seem to care about their own ego more than they do about the people they purport to represent.</description></item><item><title>Power of media</title><link>/2019/12/31/power-of-media/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/31/power-of-media/</guid><description>Despite the fact that the Marvel news about a transgender character is not true it reinforced how significant media is to progress and growth of culture. Adults are set in their ways and are less impressionable than children. By exposing children to a more accepting world we help make it a reality. It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that this news turned out to be false but the fact that it was even believable is a sign that we&amp;rsquo;re making progress.</description></item><item><title>Drop in piracy, drop in accessibility</title><link>/2019/12/27/drop-in-piracy-drop-in-accessibility/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/27/drop-in-piracy-drop-in-accessibility/</guid><description>A few days ago I came across a tweet that was making the rounds:
I agree with the sentiment and know how much I benefited from having access to software as a kid. It got me both interested in computers and gave me a head start on writing code.
The one point that&amp;rsquo;s missed here is how difficult it is to pirate software these days. In the early days of the internet it would take a very, very long time to download applications but nearly all were piratable - even if it did require running some obscure code and editing hex files.</description></item><item><title>Privacy updates and emission standards</title><link>/2019/12/20/privacy-updates-and-emission-standards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/20/privacy-updates-and-emission-standards/</guid><description>It’s that special time of the year when a whole slew of companies are sending out their privacy policy emails. Last year the culprit was GDPR, a European privacy law, and this year it&amp;rsquo;s the CCPA, the privacy protection bill from California. Given the onslaught most users will ignore these updates. These regulations seem to be having the desired effect. A bold company may choose to have separate privacy policies per geography to reduce the coverage of these laws but it looks as if most companies have just updated their general privacy policies.</description></item><item><title>Class action settlements</title><link>/2019/12/19/class-action-settlements/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/19/class-action-settlements/</guid><description>Earlier this month I received an email from Zappos with the subject &amp;ldquo;Settlement Notification re: 2012 Security Incident.&amp;rdquo; Sure enough, Zappos had a security issue in 2012 and the result of the class action lawsuit was that they&amp;rsquo;d give their affected customers a 10% off coupon on any order placed before January. As far as the typical class action settlement this was a surprisingly fair offer since it is something I&amp;rsquo;d actually use.</description></item><item><title>QR codes in China</title><link>/2019/11/02/qr-codes-in-china/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/11/02/qr-codes-in-china/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated by the way mobile works in China. Based on everything I read it seems China is far ahead of the US in the way technology has been absorbed in the day-to-day fabric of society. I&amp;rsquo;m not making the case that that&amp;rsquo;s actually a better way to be but more of an observation of how different daily life can be when technology is embraced in nearly all areas. This is much easier with China with more centralized control and a few companies, namely Tencent and Alibaba, that have monopolies over every device.</description></item><item><title>Free speech and the First Amendment</title><link>/2019/09/23/free-speech-and-the-first-amendment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/09/23/free-speech-and-the-first-amendment/</guid><description>I recently finished The Great Dissent which describes the thought process Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr went through as he changed the interpretation of the First Amendment and free speech in the United States.

There&amp;rsquo;s so much we consume that recycling only gets us so far and it&amp;rsquo;s much better to reuse as much as possible. How much better off would we all be if we were able to reuse existing containers for takeout and food delivery? It is an inconvenience but it&amp;rsquo;s much more sustainable and as a society we&amp;rsquo;d get used to it.</description></item><item><title>Toward a global government</title><link>/2019/07/14/toward-a-global-government/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/14/toward-a-global-government/</guid><description>The world isn&amp;rsquo;t in the best shape these days. There&amp;rsquo;s a rise in extreme nationalism and intolerance, climate change is leading to some wild weather, and overall it just feels we&amp;rsquo;re moving in the wrong direction. Everyone can speculate on the causes but to me it&amp;rsquo;s a function of the complicated, and often, antithetical incentives from the various global players. Each country is looking out for its own interests and despite their behavior having an impact on others.</description></item><item><title>Increasing the bar for reelection</title><link>/2019/07/04/increasing-the-bar-for-reelection/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/04/increasing-the-bar-for-reelection/</guid><description>I avoid writing about politics but in honor of July 4th I decided to pen some thoughts around elections.
Last year I wrote a post proposing that all laws should be temporary and upon expiration require a higher and higher majority to be sustained. What if we adopt a similar policy for electing politicians? In the United States different offices have different term limits: a Supreme Court Justice has a lifetime appointment, a senator has 6 years, a president has 4 (and limited to two terms), and a congressperson has 2.</description></item><item><title>Gerrymandering</title><link>/2019/04/27/gerrymandering/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/04/27/gerrymandering/</guid><description>I tend to avoid blogging about politics but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but rant against gerrymandering. The concept is rooted in the idea that political parties can divide voting areas in order to bias the populations in their favor. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense that in a functional democracy voting districts can be so easily manipulated.
The fact that one sees numerous examples of the ridiculous geographic shapes that can develop should be sign-enough that it&amp;rsquo;s an irrational approach.</description></item><item><title>Dorm rooms for adults</title><link>/2018/12/31/dorm-rooms-for-adults/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/31/dorm-rooms-for-adults/</guid><description>Not to keep beating a dead horse but the housing situation in San Francisco seems ridiculous. Back in March, the NY Times wrote an article covering Starcity, a company that builds “dorms” for professionals. The article is positioned as a positive since it’s giving people an option to live in San Francisco who may not be able to afford a place to themselves but it just feels like as if the real world is mirroring the software world.</description></item><item><title>Facebook's latest hit</title><link>/2018/12/19/facebooks-latest-hit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/19/facebooks-latest-hit/</guid><description>The Facebook hits just keep on coming. The latest is a NY Times expose around Facebook’s lack of privacy or data protection when it came to their strategic partner integrations. Citing some examples won’t do it justice and the entire article is worth a read just to see how loose Facebook was with user data. It’s shocking how ridiculous some of these practices were. I’m not surprised by the data Facebook is collecting or how it’s being used for ad targeting but I’m amazed at how much data they allowed to leave their platform.</description></item><item><title>The modern economy relies on information</title><link>/2018/12/09/the-modern-economy-relies-on-information/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/09/the-modern-economy-relies-on-information/</guid><description>In many ways modern capitalism is about bigger and bigger companies owning more and more industries. We’re seeing with the major tech companies moving into new verticals to keep growing. We’re seeing it with the media and telecom companies going on acquisition sprees aimed at both vertical integration and horizontal scale.
Yet there are also ton of small business being launched across a variety of industries - especially in consumer products.</description></item><item><title>Tragedy of the commons: Apartment edition</title><link>/2018/11/30/tragedy-of-the-commons-apartment-edition/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/30/tragedy-of-the-commons-apartment-edition/</guid><description>‘Tis the season where mailrooms get filled with delivery boxes and it’s getting busier every year. Mary Meeker mentioned the trend of building lobbies becoming ecommerce storage facilities and it’s more true than ever.

The gig economy is clearly here to stay and it’s encouraging that we’re seeing companies trying to adapt to the changes. I’m sure it’s partially for the marketing spin - both AirBnB and Uber have been facing significant criticism lately - but even then this is a good example to set for future companies.</description></item><item><title>Bulk discounts hurt competition</title><link>/2018/07/22/bulk-discounts-hurt-competition/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/07/22/bulk-discounts-hurt-competition/</guid><description>While reading yet another article about scooter startups I came across an obvious quote by Gao Lufeng, CEO of Segway-Ninebot, the leading scooter manufacturer: “As one of the biggest battery buyers, we have the bargaining power to get the lowest price in the market.”
This is obvious and we see it everywhere: buying in bulk gets you a discount. As a consumer I can go to Amazon and look at any item and the per unit price when buying a single item is going to be higher than when buying a pack.</description></item><item><title>In a software world, humanity comes first</title><link>/2018/07/10/in-a-software-world-humanity-comes-first/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/07/10/in-a-software-world-humanity-comes-first/</guid><description>Google Duplex was announced earlier this year as a way to automate tasks that require a phone call - such as booking an appointment. Rather than calling yourself google has an assistant that understands human speech and speaks convincingly enough to do these simple tasks. Relatedly, a few days I read an article describing how Google is also pushing Duplex to be used in call centers. A bit surprising but makes a ton of sense since the vast majority of the calls are relatively simple tasks that companies are already trying to automate as much as possible using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems.</description></item><item><title>Rise of microbrands</title><link>/2018/04/28/rise-of-microbrands/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/04/28/rise-of-microbrands/</guid><description>While browsing Instagram the other day I saw an ad for Optimum.

There’s a huge different in quality and joy when you compare consumer apps with government services. This is understandable: there’s more competition, fewer restraints, and more money in private enterprise so naturally government offerings won’t be as exciting. At the same time government services affect us much more than a generic app.</description></item><item><title>Death of retail</title><link>/2017/08/22/death-of-retail/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/08/22/death-of-retail/</guid><description>I keep hearing that retail is dying and while I do believe that to be true it’s been difficult to see that from living in the NYC area. The city streets are always bustling and while there are always some empty commercial spaces they seem to always get rented within a month or two. Yet this morning on my way to the office I came across a legitimate sign, literal and figurative, that brick and mortar retail is on its way out.</description></item><item><title>Cities and outsourced infrastructure</title><link>/2017/07/13/cities-and-outsourced-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/07/13/cities-and-outsourced-infrastructure/</guid><description>Earlier today I read an interesting piece about the difficulty facing Chinese bike share companies trying to enter the US market. The primary challenge is that many cities have already signed exclusive agreements with ride sharing companies and in many cases subsidized the initial investment. I find this fascinating since it highlights how even in relatively new industries it’s very easy to encounter established players that are difficult to dislodge - especially when they have the backing of the local government.</description></item><item><title>Mary Meeker's Internet Trends 2017</title><link>/2017/06/04/mary-meekers-internet-trends-2017/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/06/04/mary-meekers-internet-trends-2017/</guid><description>In what has become annual tradition, Mary Meeker has just published the 2017 Internet Trends report and it’s a whopper. Over 350 pages describing the state of the modern digital world. I can’t imagine how long it must have taken to pull the data and put it together but I’m incredibly grateful that it’s been done and continues to be done every year. There’s so much great stuff in there that it’s worth going through it on your own but I wanted to highlight the slides that stood out to me.</description></item><item><title>Subscription all the things</title><link>/2017/04/21/subscription-all-the-things/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/04/21/subscription-all-the-things/</guid><description>Reading modern technology and business news it seems that every single thing is moving to the subscription model. It’s no longer just the obvious stuff that’s being turned into a subscription with the help of technology. Software is becoming a critical part of many systems - ranging from powering cars to tractors to juicers - and would be hilarious if it weren’t so real. Software has transformed the world and now we’re trying to find the remaining places that software can be jammed into.</description></item><item><title>Embrace experimentation</title><link>/2017/03/22/embrace-experimentation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/03/22/embrace-experimentation/</guid><description>Rather than debating various approaches the best way to determine the ideal option is to run an experiment and look at the outcome. The tech industry has embraced this and is constantly running all sorts of A/B tests to optimize any and all metrics. Unfortunately, this approach hasn’t spread to the rest of society where decisions are based on abstract theories and perceptions. Imagine how much society could improve if we expanded experimentation into policies affecting our cities, states, and countries.</description></item><item><title>Mancur Olson and the changing economy</title><link>/2017/02/13/mancur-olson-and-the-changing-economy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/02/13/mancur-olson-and-the-changing-economy/</guid><description>I studied economics in college but only encountered Mancur Olson years later when I picked up “The Rise and Decline of Nations” at a bookstore years later. It proposes a simple theory that explains why some countries succeed while others fail - as a country maintains growth and stability it ends up developing more and entrenched interests that hobble future growth. Olson uses a variety of historical economic examples to prove this point - ranging from the British empire to Germany and Japan post World War II - that make a compelling case.</description></item><item><title>New law?

Whenever a new law is passed it’s incredibly difficult to have it repealed since there are enough people benefiting who will fight against the removal. This leads to a situation where instead of replacing old laws with new laws we end up with a massive system of laws with new ones that just get thrown on. This leads to a whole slew of inefficiencies and requires experts to help navigate the landscape who themselves benefit from the complexity and want to maintain it as much as they can.</description></item><item><title>The freedom to move</title><link>/2017/01/28/the-freedom-to-move/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/01/28/the-freedom-to-move/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this thought for a while now but Trump&amp;rsquo;s latest executive order banning Muslim immigration is forcing me to put it in writing. The freedom to move should be a human right and can act as the foundation of all others. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like the policies of your city? Move to another one. Your state? Move to another one. Your country? Same thing.
By giving people the freedom to choose where they live policies will arise that benefit the greatest number of people.</description></item><item><title>Powering our devices using the human body</title><link>/2017/01/16/powering-our-devices-using-the-human-body/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/01/16/powering-our-devices-using-the-human-body/</guid><description>Lately I’ve been thinking of how we’re moving more and more to a world where humans will start merging with technology. We’re already carrying our phones around nearly every minute of every day but at least we keep them in our pockets. Watches are always on our wrists and with augmented reality the permanently attached technologies will only grow.
At some point they’ll just become part of our bodies and I was curious what additional energy we’d need to consume in order to power these devices.</description></item><item><title>Human-AI cooperation</title><link>/2016/12/30/human-ai-cooperation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/12/30/human-ai-cooperation/</guid><description>There’s been a lot written about the rise of AI and the impending automation which will lead to a mass reduction in industries requiring a human touch. The counterargument is that every time there has been a technological improvement new, higher value jobs have been created that more than offset the loss.

In a perfect world every device would be up to date with the latest updates and it would be difficult to compromise anything that’s connected to the internet. Unfortunately, this is not the case and there’s an ever growing number of devices that are quickly hacked together and sold without any focus placed on security.</description></item><item><title>Friction and mass surveillance</title><link>/2016/10/09/friction-and-mass-surveillance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/10/09/friction-and-mass-surveillance/</guid><description>One of the best arguments I’ve heard against mass surveillance is that the marginal cost has dropped to nearly zero which warps the system. Since so much of our world is digital it costs the government nothing extra to collect each additional data point. Given these incentives it’s no surprise that the government was able to get the major companies to provide a dedicated feed of the data they were collecting - modern technology has enabled both the collection and analysis of massive amounts of data.</description></item><item><title>Comparing my top sites: 2012 vs now</title><link>/2016/09/10/comparing-my-top-sites-2012-vs-now/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/09/10/comparing-my-top-sites-2012-vs-now/</guid><description>While going through and making sure each of my old posts was AMP compatible I came across a post from 2012 where I tried to list the first autocomplete suggestion for each letter.

I was reminded of this when my mortgage loan was sold to a new servicer. I came home to find a letter in the mail notifying me that my loan has been sold and that going forward I’d have to use a different payment portal and system. It was simple enough to register but the payment process became less efficient and there was no support for a Mint integration.</description></item><item><title>Uber and self driving cars</title><link>/2016/05/28/uber-and-self-driving-cars/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/05/28/uber-and-self-driving-cars/</guid><description>Self driving cars are inevitable and yet I’m surprised by how aggressive Uber is in contributing to the space. Uber is winning right now due to massive network effects.

The content itself isn&amp;rsquo;t new - it highlights the typical conflict between those that view Airbnb as violating local ordinances and ruining the city and others who believe that Airbnb brings value and is helping New Orleans rebuild after Katrina.
But what was interesting was the repeated claims of Airbnb and the other rental marketplaces that it’s just not scalable to follow local policies for every city and it’s up to the users to know their local regulations and follow them.</description></item><item><title>Platform partnerships</title><link>/2016/02/22/platform-partnerships/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/02/22/platform-partnerships/</guid><description>I set up the Amazon Echo over the weekend and have been an active user of my wife’s Spotify account which comes integrated with the Echo.

Cheap and easy transportation is the immediate change but there will be massive secondary effects to the shapes of cities and society.

One thing that’s been on my mind is how it will fit into human behavior and biases. We’re so used to making infrequent or one time payments and then owning something that moving to a rental or sharing model might be difficult. For example, I don’t own a car and mostly rely on a combination of public transportation and CitIBike to get around.</description></item><item><title>Smartphones and literacy</title><link>/2013/12/26/smartphones-and-literacy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/12/26/smartphones-and-literacy/</guid><description>Source: Business Insider
In 2012 global smartphone ownership surpassed PC ownership and smartphones are still seeing massive growth. The obvious consequence is that many people who’ve never owned a computer are starting to own smartphones and that’s having a huge impact on the world. Almost everything will be affected - not just technology but also business, politics, and general culture. As these smartphones get more powerful and pervasive we’ll see applications that we can’t even imagine right now.</description></item></channel></rss>
