The successful companies don’t just focus on the results their product will deliver but also spend time explaining why those results are important and how the product works and how it can be used.
This approach seems obvious to me. Borrowing some terminology from Crossing the Chasm, the early adopters will use your product as long as it solves an existing problem but education will help the remaining, slower adopting customer segments discover that they even have a problem and look to you for a solution.</description></item><item><title>Where are you on the sales matrix?</title><link>/2013/06/21/where-are-you-on-the-sales-matrix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/06/21/where-are-you-on-the-sales-matrix/</guid><description>Something I’ve been thinking about is the variety of sales approaches. On one extreme, you have pharmaceutical companies sending sales reps to visit doctors offices to try to get them to prescribe their drugs. On the other you have companies such as MixPanel and Dropbox which rely on a self serve approach. And in between you have companies such as NewRelic which offer a self-serve trial and try to upsell you with emails from a sales rep.</description></item><item><title>Selling to the enterprise? Target the consumer</title><link>/2012/05/22/selling-to-the-enterprise-target-the-consumer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/05/22/selling-to-the-enterprise-target-the-consumer/</guid><description>A trend I’ve been noticing more and more is enterprise sales being done bottoms up. The typical approach is to offer a free trials or have some sort of freemium product. Each sign up is then treated as an inbound lead that is assigned an account manager. Within two weeks of signing up for New Relic I was contacted by an account manager who helped answer my questions and helped me get New Relic set up for Glossi.</description></item></channel></rss>
