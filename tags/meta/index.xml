Years ago I redesigned my entire site to use AMP across all devices, powered by Jekyll, and hosted on GitHub pages. At the end of 2020 I decided I was ready to abandon AMP and move toward a more traditional and straightforward setup while leveraging a more modern toolchain.
Due to my adoption of AMP my Jekyll/GitHub Pages setup was highly custom.</description></item><item><title>2021 goals</title><link>/2020/12/29/2021-goals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/29/2021-goals/</guid><description>Despite 2020 showing us how unpredictable the world can be, it&amp;rsquo;s that wonderful time of the year when everyone comes up with goals for the upcoming year. On one hand it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to predict what will happen but on the other hand it is useful to give some sense of purpose and direction. Being thoughtful and public around our goals is also a way to encourage us to commit and see them through completion.</description></item><item><title>Time to remove AMP from my blog</title><link>/2020/12/29/time-to-remove-amp-from-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/29/time-to-remove-amp-from-my-blog/</guid><description>A few years ago I redid this entire blog to use AMP - not just for mobile but also for desktop. The motivation was to improve the performance while scratching my curiosity itch. It was a fun experiment but these days I&amp;rsquo;m more averse to Google&amp;rsquo;s dominance and think I can do even better by taking what I liked from AMP but going even simpler. It took quite a bit of work to get everything working the way I wanted to in AMP - for example converting AMP markup into a valid RSS feed and getting Disqus working - and while it&amp;rsquo;ll be a shame to undo all that work it feels like the right time.</description></item><item><title>Blogging: 2020 and beyond</title><link>/2020/12/28/blogging-2020-and-beyond/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/28/blogging-2020-and-beyond/</guid><description>I have a script I use to analyze and visualize my blogging. One script generates a simple CSV file containing a variety of metadata about my blogging that I then feed into a Grafana dashboard to see how I&amp;rsquo;m doing. Another script does some simple visualizations. In the past years I had an annual tradition of sharing these visualizations and describing each one but I took a look at this year&amp;rsquo;s and for the most part there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that interesting.</description></item><item><title>SpaceX Starship vs Saturn V</title><link>/2020/12/27/spacex-starship-vs-saturn-v/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/27/spacex-starship-vs-saturn-v/</guid><description>As a kid I used to be obsessed with all things space. A big part was having the same name as the head of NASA, Daniel Goldin, where I harbored illusions that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have to change the nameplate on the door. My parents supported this interest and got me subscriptions to a variety of space and science magazines. I did not go the space route but despite that I&amp;rsquo;m sure that passion and curiosity contributed to my growth and I still have a soft spot for space.</description></item><item><title>2020 donations</title><link>/2020/12/26/2020-donations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/26/2020-donations/</guid><description>Last year I wrote a short post highlighting my donations with the hope that they encourage others to donate. Given this year&amp;rsquo;s trials and tribulations it&amp;rsquo;s even more important to donate and help others if you have the means.
I continued my donations from last year and donated to the EFF, ACLU, Wikipedia, and Planned Parenthood for the same reasons as last year. The additions this year have been a function of everything that&amp;rsquo;s happened.</description></item><item><title>Browser zero</title><link>/2020/12/22/browser-zero/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/22/browser-zero/</guid><description>Inbox Zero is a productivity philosophy that&amp;rsquo;s centered around getting to an empty email inbox. That means you treat your inbox as a todo list and once you&amp;rsquo;ve handled every email you&amp;rsquo;re good to go.

The year was a tough one for most people but all things considered I&amp;rsquo;m in a privileged position and can&amp;rsquo;t blame COVID too much. For sure there were periods of ennui but the root was that I just lost interest and motivation in some of these.</description></item><item><title>Blame the algorithm</title><link>/2020/12/19/blame-the-algorithm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/19/blame-the-algorithm/</guid><description>Stanford Medicine is in the news for using an &amp;ldquo;algorithm&amp;rdquo; and allocating minimal COVID vaccines to those actually on the frontlines. Instead it supposedly prioritized senior administrators who are working from home. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s some truth to the algorithm biasing allocation to those who are older but whenever I see someone blame an algorithm my spidey-sense goes off. The algorithm in this case was likely some extremely simple calculation in Excel that could have been easily verified by a human - both before it was run as well as a quick analysis of the results.</description></item><item><title>Impact of getting to the top of Hacker News in 2020</title><link>/2020/12/13/impact-of-getting-to-the-top-of-hacker-news-in-2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/13/impact-of-getting-to-the-top-of-hacker-news-in-2020/</guid><description>Two days ago I wrote up a quick post highlighting how Amazon owns more than $2B domains and it struck a nerve. It&amp;rsquo;s been shared quite a bit on Twitter and I posted it to Hacker News on Friday night before going to bed to wake up to it being near the top which drove a ton of views. It&amp;rsquo;s always a surprise seeing what takes off but there&amp;rsquo;s something about Amazon owning billions of dollars in domains that&amp;rsquo;s shocking and gets people riled up.</description></item><item><title>Evolution of open source licenses</title><link>/2020/12/12/evolution-of-open-source-licenses/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/12/evolution-of-open-source-licenses/</guid><description>Open source changed the way we write code. It&amp;rsquo;s given many of us a starting set of tools that allowed us to quickly put together new products and allowed us to specialize. These days open source is as strong as ever but there are a lot of changes happening on the licensing side. Under the older open source licenses, any company could take your code and then launch it as their own service.</description></item><item><title>Pay to enjoy video games</title><link>/2020/12/08/pay-to-enjoy-video-games/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/08/pay-to-enjoy-video-games/</guid><description>As a kid I was incredibly addicted to video games. I had a whole cat-and-mouse routine going on with my parents. They would put a BIOS boot password on the computer and I would open up the case, remove the battery, and reset the BIOS settings. They would lock the basement, where our one and only computer was located, and I would climb in through the window. They would lock the door to the computer room and I would undo the door hinges.</description></item><item><title>Subconciously learning to type Russian</title><link>/2020/11/22/subconciously-learning-to-type-russian/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/11/22/subconciously-learning-to-type-russian/</guid><description>I was born in the Soviet Union, came over as a 5 year old, and have seen my Russian getting worse and worse due to a lack of exposure. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using quarantine as a way to practice and improve my Russian through daily lessons in the Duolingo app. It&amp;rsquo;s a well designed app and while it has some flaws I&amp;rsquo;m on a 191 day streak and am loath to give it up.</description></item><item><title>Cursed by GDPR</title><link>/2020/11/20/cursed-by-gdpr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/11/20/cursed-by-gdpr/</guid><description>I had a fun little experience over the past few days. Someone had ordered Domino&amp;rsquo;s in the UK and seemingly typed in my email address by accident. This gave me the privilege of receiving daily emails from Domino&amp;rsquo;s promoting their latest deal. The first few days it was novel and interesting seeing what was popular across the pond but this morning I decided I might as well unsubscribe.
Lo and behold the unsubscribe link didn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description></item><item><title>Substack and paid newsletters</title><link>/2020/10/21/substack-and-paid-newsletters/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/10/21/substack-and-paid-newsletters/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s starting to feel as if everyone I follow on Twitter is launching a Substack newsletter. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how this plays out but my inbox is already overwhelmed and having more longish-form content to go through just won&amp;rsquo;t happen. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting space that&amp;rsquo;s changing quickly and will look very different in a few years. Many seem to think that there&amp;rsquo;s a huge opportunity here for authors to build a niche audience that&amp;rsquo;s able to sustain their writing but i&amp;rsquo;m not wholly convinced.</description></item><item><title>Cold turkey and fighting temptations</title><link>/2020/09/22/cold-turkey-and-fighting-temptations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/09/22/cold-turkey-and-fighting-temptations/</guid><description>Some people are able to control urges but I&amp;rsquo;m much better off just removing the objects of desire entirely. In high school this manifested in me spending way too much time on video games. These days it&amp;rsquo;s buying a bag of potato chips and then being unable to stop once I crack it up. I tried giving TikTok a go to see what all the fuss was about but had to drop it cold turkey after realizing that I was spending too much time on it.</description></item><item><title>Get Google Group membership using Calendar</title><link>/2020/09/05/get-google-group-membership-using-calendar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/09/05/get-google-group-membership-using-calendar/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where I discovered this tip but I&amp;rsquo;ll often want to know the members of a Google group. The ways to get this are constantly changing - from double clicking the group within the Gmail compose window for a summary modal to going deep into the Groups UI.

There were a variety of reasons for switching back but the ultimate reason was simply that I had stability issues on Ubuntu and it was rare for it to go a week without freezing up. The overall lack of polish in Ubuntu didn&amp;rsquo;t help but I could have dealt with it had it not be for the frequent freezes and crashes.</description></item><item><title>An era of productivity</title><link>/2020/08/21/an-era-of-productivity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/08/21/an-era-of-productivity/</guid><description>A trap software engineers usually fall into is underestimating how long some things will take and I&amp;rsquo;m no different. Yet lately I&amp;rsquo;ve somehow been on the other end. Nearly every task I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do the past few weeks - either technical, managerial, or personal - has ended up taking a shorter amount of time than I expected. The blocker has been getting into the mindset and finding the time to do it but once I start I crank it out.</description></item><item><title>Traveling at the speed of light through life</title><link>/2020/08/16/traveling-at-the-speed-of-light-through-life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/08/16/traveling-at-the-speed-of-light-through-life/</guid><description>Years ago I was reading The Elegant Universe and came across a mind-blowing idea - both then and every time I remember it: we&amp;rsquo;re always traveling at the speed of light through four dimensions - the three spatial dimensions as well as time. It just happens that almost all of that speed is through time. But that does mean that as you speed up in the spatial dimensions, time slows down - which has been shown to be true by measuring time drift in airplanes.</description></item><item><title>Amusing Russian translations in Duolingo</title><link>/2020/07/24/amusing-russian-translations-in-duolingo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/07/24/amusing-russian-translations-in-duolingo/</guid><description>Many are using the lockdown as a way to improve themselves. I grew up a native Russian speaker which has unfortunately eroded over the years and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past few months improving my Russian through Duolingo. It&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly effective app and has enough gamification to keep me going. My approach has been to just take the tests to skip out of lessons until I master every lesson. It started off easy but I&amp;rsquo;m now failing to advance about 20% of the time.</description></item><item><title>Software defined photography</title><link>/2020/06/15/software-defined-photography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/06/15/software-defined-photography/</guid><description>I was talking to a coworker earlier today about the ridiculous quality of today&amp;rsquo;s smartphone cameras. He pointed out how it&amp;rsquo;s becoming more and more difficult for professional photographers to charge what they have been. The parallel here is how the invention of photography. That completely destroyed the value of artists and yet led to the launch of the modern art movements - Impressionism, Surrealism, Data, and countless others.

The explanation is that AlphaGo doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about the margin of victory, just the victory itself. It&amp;rsquo;s trying to maximize the likelihood of winning, not the score differential - and that leads to a unique playing style.
I found this part of the documentary fascinating as it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that&amp;rsquo;s obvious when explained but you&amp;rsquo;d never stop to think about.</description></item><item><title>Google and Apple's COVID tracking project</title><link>/2020/04/18/google-and-apples-covid-tracking-project/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/04/18/google-and-apples-covid-tracking-project/</guid><description>Google and Apple recently announced a partnership to help people anonymously see if they&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to someone with COVID. The idea itself is elegant and does a nice job balancing the functionality with the need for privacy. One of the most common takes I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in tech circles is that no one will use it due to a concern for privacy.
I think the opposite. I believe that with enough marketing this will be a massive success.</description></item><item><title>Disabling TabNine to improve Ubuntu performance</title><link>/2020/03/29/disabling-tabnine-to-improve-ubuntu-performance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/03/29/disabling-tabnine-to-improve-ubuntu-performance/</guid><description>At the end of 2018 I switched from using a Mac to using Ubuntu on a ThinkPad. While much of the development experience is better the one thing that&amp;rsquo;s noticeably worse is performance (usually first noticed in browsers) coupled with the occasional computer freeze.

I&amp;rsquo;d resist paying for anything if I could find an open source alternative that worked reasonably well. These days I prioritize my effectiveness and am much more likely to pay for the right tool. A great example of this is my search for a database IDE.

These days it feels that there are only four: Facebook, Instagram (I&amp;rsquo;m explicitly separating it out from Facebook), Twitter, and Snapchat. This is a very US view and I realize there are tons of niche ones but at this point it feels as if those constitute the bulk of usage. More importantly, and this is pure speculation, it seems as if you pick a random person and look at their social network usage it&amp;rsquo;s very likely they&amp;rsquo;re spending the majority, if not all of their time, in only one of those networks.</description></item><item><title>Farewell 2019, hello 2020</title><link>/2019/12/31/farewell-2019-hello-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/31/farewell-2019-hello-2020/</guid><description>Bill Gates once said &amp;ldquo;Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s a good assessment of my decade.

This is leading to a variety of companies that are building kitchens that can be rented out by these types of restaurants. In fact, one of them, CloudKitchens, is Travis Kalanick new startup attempt.
Given that these businesses depend on food delivery platforms and they don&amp;rsquo;t actually have a retail location I wonder if these restaurants are creating multiple listings on these platforms.</description></item><item><title>Zappos customer service</title><link>/2019/12/30/zappos-customer-service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/30/zappos-customer-service/</guid><description>The outcome of the Zappos class action settlement was 10% of an order that needs to be made by January 2020.

Maybe it’s due to the slower typing speed, the lack of distraction, the novelty, or just self-deception but it feels as if some of my previous rough drafts have had both more interesting thoughts, analogies, and wordsmithing.

I resisted an upgrade for as long as I could but what finally got me over the hump was not any of the features, as incredible as they are, but instead the need for a longer battery life.
My 6S couldn’t last a few hours of limited usage without running out of power. Similar to how someone will look at their gas tank before leaving on a trip I was doing the same for my phone’s battery charge any time I&amp;rsquo;d be away from a charger.</description></item><item><title>DeAMPifying my blog</title><link>/2019/12/21/deampifying-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/21/deampifying-my-blog/</guid><description>Since September of 2016 this blog has been exclusively (both mobile and desktop) in AMP.

One of the most common refrains was that to be more efficient one had to do everything with the keyboard: no mouse allowed. The idea here that keyboard shortcuts are going to be much faster than navigating menus with a mouse.
You don’t hear this too often in software engineering but it applies just as much.</description></item><item><title>2019 Predictions in review</title><link>/2019/12/12/2019-predictions-in-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/12/2019-predictions-in-review/</guid><description>At the end of 2018 I made four predictions for 2019 and now that we&amp;rsquo;re nearing the end of the year it&amp;rsquo;s time to see how accurate they were. It&amp;rsquo;s a valuable exercise to review them - both to hold myself accountable but also to get a glimpse of how I thought about the world a year ago. It&amp;rsquo;s also a way to understand the biases I fall into and use that information to hopefully improve my predictions for 2020.</description></item><item><title>Strive for linear complexity</title><link>/2019/12/11/strive-for-linear-complexity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/11/strive-for-linear-complexity/</guid><description>Good software is dynamic and evolves as the requirements grow. The code usually starts clean, elegant, and simple but inevitably grows in complexity. The challenge is to manage that growing complexity. My approach is to strive to make that complexity linear rather than multiplicative. A multiplicative approach is one where a new requirement forces you to think through other parts of your code and determine what needs to change. A linear approach is one where this additional requirement forces you to think through others in its class but not much beyond that.</description></item><item><title>Solve categories, not individual problems</title><link>/2019/12/10/solve-categories-not-individual-problems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/10/solve-categories-not-individual-problems/</guid><description>One of the most valuable abilities in modern software development is the ability to solve entire categories of issues instead of the immediate problem in front of us. It&amp;rsquo;s simpler and tempting to solve what&amp;rsquo;s in front of us so and then move on. It takes discipline and thoroughness to understand the problem, diagnose its cause, and prevent similar problems from arising in the future.

I unfortunately have no idea where it is and have very little use for one now but it was an incredible machine.
It came with a built in solver and an algebraic manipulation library which made solving all sorts of problems a breeze. Rather than being purely decimal based it also expressed irrational and rational numbers which came in incredibly healthy for many tests.</description></item><item><title>Thanksgiving</title><link>/2019/11/28/thanksgiving/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/11/28/thanksgiving/</guid><description>Despite Black Friday being my least favorite day of the year Thanksgiving is by far my favorite holiday.

Sanctions have a time and place but make very little sense when it comes to GitHub. The entire idea of GitHub is to spread open source which aligns closely with democratic ideals and principles. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to hurt a country economically to drive change but a whole other to prevent their population from accessing information.
Totalitarian countries want to control access to information and the way to fight that is to make it as easy as possible to make it available and this move is the exact opposite of what should happen.</description></item><item><title>My Ubuntu experinece</title><link>/2019/07/14/my-ubuntu-experinece/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/14/my-ubuntu-experinece/</guid><description>At the end of 2018 I made the shift from OS X on a Macbook Pro to Ubuntu on a Thinkpad and it&amp;rsquo;s been enough time for me to get used to the new setup while still remember the old one so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my experiences.

While adding tags to one of these posts I typed in startup and saw the following suggestions and their frequencies: Startup (334K), Startup Lessons (10.8K), Startup Life (3.6K), Startup Marketing (2.3K), and Startup Ideas (1.1K).
The frequencies stood out. It makes sense that the generic term “startup” would have the highest volume but it’s interesting to see how the others compare.</description></item><item><title>State of tech in 2018</title><link>/2018/12/14/state-of-tech-in-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/14/state-of-tech-in-2018/</guid><description>I’m a big fan of the Stratechery newsletter and eagerly read every article that comes out. This past week a post came out that gave a wonderful description of the state of tech in 2018:
This, then, is the state of technology in 2018: the enterprise market is thriving, and the consumer market is stagnant, dominated by the “innovations” that a few large behemoths deign to develop for consumers (probably by ripping off a smaller company).</description></item><item><title>The price of AWS vs GitHub</title><link>/2018/12/11/the-price-of-aws-vs-github/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/11/the-price-of-aws-vs-github/</guid><description>This is a bit of an odd comparison since they offer two very different services with very different cost models but it’s just incredible how much more expensive AWS is than GitHub. It makes sense that GitHub is significantly cheaper since it’s fundamentally just git hosting and it has virtually zero marginal costs to support new customers. AWS on the other hand is bills entirely based on usage and has to allocate the additional hardware for every customer and is definitely not zero marginal cost.</description></item><item><title>Avoiding content overload</title><link>/2018/12/09/avoiding-content-overload/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/09/avoiding-content-overload/</guid><description>While going through my list of blog post ideas I found one from a few years ago titled “Content Overload” which was meant to highlight how much content I was bombarded with across a variety of channels.

For example, instead of actually making a call to a restaurant on my behalf it would just use the various booking sites already out there, such as OpenTable, to make the reservation. From the caller’s experience the two are indistinguishable since you’re just using your voice but on the restaurant side there’s no need to talk to someone to do something that can be done through a series of API calls.</description></item><item><title>Conference call echoes</title><link>/2018/12/06/conference-call-echoes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/06/conference-call-echoes/</guid><description>I’m sure conference calls have improved significantly over the past decade yet they still feel incredibly behind.

In June 2018 the top 5 browsers had an estimated 94.98% share of the browser market. This makes sense since most people either use their OS’s default browser or find a mainstream alternative, such as Chrome or Firefox. Yet there’s a lot of interesting and novel browser work happening on the fringes. Brave, started by Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript and cofounder of the Mozilla project), is designed for privacy and comes with built-in adblocking; Vivaldi is all about customization and tab management; UC Browser is all about mobile performance - and is, in fact, the third most popular mobile browser.</description></item><item><title>How many wifi devices do we have?</title><link>/2018/12/04/how-many-wifi-devices-do-we-have/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/04/how-many-wifi-devices-do-we-have/</guid><description>Benedict Evans wrote a great post back in 2014 that started with the observation that while our grandparents knew how many motors they owned we have no idea and that while we know how many of our devices connect to the internet our children will not.

One of the tricks I’ve been using is to disable all images and avoid clicking any links that don’t go directly to the desired location.

Amazon’s an incredibly competitive company with a ton of defensive moats but one I haven’t seen mentioned much is also the one I think is one of the most powerful: its sheer number of employees. And rather than having them isolated to a few key offices they’re spread out across a variety of cities, states, and countries. Amazon has over 340,000 employees which is almost 5 times the size of Google’s 72,000.</description></item><item><title>Focus on the story</title><link>/2017/08/28/focus-on-the-story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/08/28/focus-on-the-story/</guid><description>Last week we hosted a meetup describing the evolution of our data pipeline over the past 5 years - starting with a simple script to aggregate log files to a fully fledged big data system relying on a slew of technologies ranging from Kafka to Spark to Redshift.

One small tidbit I discovered was that it would cost you $100 just to watch it in the comfort of your own home. And while I definitely don’t consider myself a sports fan that still feels ridiculous.
Everyone believes that the live nature of sports makes them completely different than other media and yet that doesn’t strike a chord with me.</description></item><item><title>A Snapcode in the mail</title><link>/2017/08/12/a-snapcode-in-the-mail/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/08/12/a-snapcode-in-the-mail/</guid><description>Earlier today I received one of those typical promotions in the mail from Jet.com - $20 off for a $100 purchase. Nothing special about the offer itself but something I found fascinating was that there was a Snapcode that when scanned via Snapchat took you to a mobile optimized Jet.com page within Snapchat. Most mail I’ve seen has the callouts to encourage people to follow the brand on Facebook and Twitter but this promotion didn’t have either of those - just the Snapcode.</description></item><item><title>Start with pen and paper</title><link>/2017/08/10/start-with-pen-and-paper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/08/10/start-with-pen-and-paper/</guid><description>Oftentimes when starting a new project I have a tendency to just dive in.

Imagine a computer sending a message to another computer and then immediately deleting it. This message then gets sent from computer to computer without actually getting saved down anywhere. It doesn’t have a permanent home and just hops from machine to machine. If that computer shuts down before the message is passed on then it’s lost forever.</description></item><item><title>The wild world of online trackers</title><link>/2017/07/23/the-wild-world-of-online-trackers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/07/23/the-wild-world-of-online-trackers/</guid><description>Working in AdTech I’m slightly more aware of how modern digital advertising works compared to the average person and get curious when I see an for a brand that I have never seen before.

I can’t count how many different lines of business Amazon has but this is yet another step in its quest to capture every consumer dollar spent.

When things are running smoothly each brings skill, knowledge, and experience the others cannot. When things are running poorly the teams do not respect or trust each other and question the others’ approach and decision making. Inevitably this leads to a flawed product that doesn’t solve customer needs and gets replaced by one that does. It’s possible to ride previous success through inertia, marketing, and price but to grow in the modern era you need to focus on product.</description></item><item><title>IVR to SMS</title><link>/2017/05/25/ivr-to-sms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/05/25/ivr-to-sms/</guid><description>Seems it’s all about messaging now and yet we somehow still have the ridiculous automated call systems which the industry calls interactive voice response. Every single person I know hates having to call a customer support number only to hear a robotic voice that requires a series of frustrated enunciations to get what you wanted.

Unless it’s a throwaway project it’s always worth spending the extra time to define your objects and the way they will be exposed in the code. This investment makes it more likely that you’ve thought through the way the code will need to evolve and the various edge cases you need to handle.
This philosophy is even more important when thinking about your database structure since that’s going to be even more difficult to change than your code.</description></item><item><title>In praise of the polymath</title><link>/2017/05/13/in-praise-of-the-polymath/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/05/13/in-praise-of-the-polymath/</guid><description>These days it’s incredibly easy to keep learning and find information on any topic but it’s much rarer to find people that are interested in everything they come across. More often you find people passionate about a few domains that are the most relevant to them and don’t bother pursuing knowledge of anything new. This mindset is both sad and irritating - why would someone consciously limit their knowledge?
Beyond knowledge for knowledge’s sake it’s valuable to train your mind to learn and absorb information; you never know when it can come in handy.</description></item><item><title>Tools over languages</title><link>/2017/05/07/tools-over-languages/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/05/07/tools-over-languages/</guid><description>The more I code the more I’m convinced that the quality of tools determines the value of a programming language. Some languages, such as Haskell, have wonderful and elegant design and are a joy to write but mostly remain hobby languages. Other languages, on the other hand, such as Java, may be rote and uninspired but have a massive amount of supported tools that allow them to keep growing. Unless we’re exploring or playing around the ultimate goal of every line of code we write is for it to be deployed to production and solid tools allow that to happen.</description></item><item><title>SQL is the perfect interface</title><link>/2017/04/11/sql-is-the-perfect-interface/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/04/11/sql-is-the-perfect-interface/</guid><description>The more I code the more I’m exposed to SQL.

Nearly all code is taking some data, transforming it, and passing it along somewhere else. This implies that modifications change or add to this flow. It may be passing an additional variable to a function, changing the behavior of a function, or adding another step in our execution. It turns out that if the code is poorly written a seemingly minor change may require changing a series of functions since for some reason each function in the flow needs to be modified.</description></item><item><title>The effects of marketing on price</title><link>/2017/03/25/the-effects-of-marketing-on-price/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/03/25/the-effects-of-marketing-on-price/</guid><description>I like to think of myself as extremely relational and efficient and something that’s always bothered me is marketing. I hated the idea that companies had to market their products since the cost of the marketing would just be absorbed into the price I would be paying for the final product. Of course it’s not that simple and marketing isn’t just a cost and can bring value to everyone involved. In fact, George Akerlof wrote a paper in 1970, The Market for Lemons, which describes how markets with asymmetric information end up full of “lemons” and led to a Noble Prize.</description></item><item><title>Advice for coding bootcamp graduates</title><link>/2017/02/21/advice-for-coding-bootcamp-graduates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/02/21/advice-for-coding-bootcamp-graduates/</guid><description>Coding bootcamps are increasingly popular and I’ve seen a large number of resumes come across my desk so wanted to share my perspective and offer some advice.

Whenever a new law is passed it’s incredibly difficult to have it repealed since there are enough people benefiting who will fight against the removal. This leads to a situation where instead of replacing old laws with new laws we end up with a massive system of laws with new ones that just get thrown on. This leads to a whole slew of inefficiencies and requires experts to help navigate the landscape who themselves benefit from the complexity and want to maintain it as much as they can.</description></item><item><title>Identifying product weaknesses using Google autocomplete</title><link>/2017/02/04/identifying-product-weaknesses-using-google-autocomplete/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/02/04/identifying-product-weaknesses-using-google-autocomplete/</guid><description>A simple trick I’ve started using when learning about new tools or technologies is to just type in “{name} vs” in Google search and see what pops up.

What’s so special about the teams that succeed? There’s obviously the coaching but I believe the bulk of the credit should go to the players.

One big item I needed to take care of was converting all my images to be AMP compatible by replacing &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tag with &amp;lt;amp-img&amp;gt; along with the image width and height. I ended up writing a quick Python script to go through each of my posts, find each &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tag, get the image’s dimensions, and then replace the original tag wit the AMP version.</description></item><item><title>AMPifying my blog</title><link>/2016/09/05/ampifying-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/09/05/ampifying-my-blog/</guid><description>Ever since AMP was announced I’ve been meaning to migrate my blog but hesitated due to the fear that it would take an inordinate amount of time and would be laden with edge cases.

A quick GitHub search showed two promising repos - amp-jekyll and amplify - and I gave them both a shot.</description></item><item><title>Violating the norms of a social network</title><link>/2016/09/01/violating-the-norms-of-a-social-network/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/09/01/violating-the-norms-of-a-social-network/</guid><description>Social networks carry extreme network effects and have massive winner-take-all dynamics. This makes it impossible for two social networks that have the same pitch to co-exist and leads to pretty strong differentiation. Facebook owns relationships. Twitter owns interests. Instagram owns lifestyle. Snapchat is starting to own experience. This is why I find it fascinating when the content from one social network or medium bleeds into another. Twitter doesn’t allow for tweets longer than 140 characters so people overcome that by sharing screengrabs of long form text.</description></item><item><title>Food identification with Google's Cloud Vision</title><link>/2016/08/29/food-identification-with-googles-cloud-vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/08/29/food-identification-with-googles-cloud-vision/</guid><description>Something that I haven’t quite figured out is how to avoid wasting food. I like to think I keep good track of everything in my fridge but too often I end up finding something in the corner that spoiled and needs to be thrown out. Earlier today I was talking to someone at the office about this problem and how nice it would be if you could just have something that knows everything that’s in the fridge and can track how long it’s been there and an estimate of how long it will last.</description></item><item><title>Giving wallabag a shot</title><link>/2016/08/28/giving-wallabag-a-shot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/08/28/giving-wallabag-a-shot/</guid><description>I’ve been a happy Instapaper user for years but the news that it was being acquired by Pinterest got me thinking about some alternatives.

This expresses itself as a strong bias for text above nearly another format.

Sure enough, investors interpreted this as good move by Amazon (up 1.51% at end of day) while hurting Netflix (down 2.79% at end of day and even more post earnings). These percentages translate into a $1.34B decrease to the Netflix valuation and a $4.49B increase in valuation for Amazon. As a shareholder of both I find this behavior interesting for its irrationality.</description></item><item><title>Ben Thompson's “laddering up” and building bigger moats</title><link>/2016/04/03/ben-thompsons-laddering-up-and-building-bigger-moats/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/04/03/ben-thompsons-laddering-up-and-building-bigger-moats/</guid><description>Last weekend I finished the The Everything Store, which details the rise of Amazon from a fledgling online book retailer to its current form.

They started with books but were able to grow into other smaller products once they figured out the logistics behind shipping smaller items.</description></item><item><title>Unbundling politics</title><link>/2016/03/27/unbundling-politics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/27/unbundling-politics/</guid><description>Yesterday I made the case that the current political system consists of a series of product bundles and I’ve been thinking of ways unbundling would work. And what better way than to look at existing products and industries that have been unbundled.
As numerous people have pointed out, the music industry is a clear example. Initially music was sold on CDs and there was no idea of buying solo songs. But with the launch of the iPod, iTunes, and internet proliferation it became possible to buy individual songs.</description></item><item><title>Political parties are product bundles</title><link>/2016/03/26/political-parties-are-product-bundles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/26/political-parties-are-product-bundles/</guid><description>I rarely write about politics but it’s an election year and I had an interesting realization. Political parties are just like product bundles. We each have our own issues and policies we’re passionate about but it’s impossible to find a politician, less a party, that has the same views we do. Instead we have political parties that take a few issues and policies and try to wrap them up in a bundle hoping to appeal to enough people to win an election.</description></item><item><title>Data analysis needs to be fun</title><link>/2016/03/21/data-analysis-needs-to-be-fun/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/21/data-analysis-needs-to-be-fun/</guid><description>In order to do any meaningful data analysis you need to have fun doing it. Otherwise it becomes a chore that’s extended by each additional analysis you run and each additional failed attempt at an insight. This requires a positive attitude and enjoying the slow, methodical process of discovery and appreciating each iteration while getting closer to the end goal. The vast majority of analyses lead to no new insight, especially when all the easy stuff has already been figured out, and it’s critical to remain the optimist while appreciating the present.</description></item><item><title>Passing the torch: IBM to Google</title><link>/2016/03/20/passing-the-torch-ibm-to-google/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/20/passing-the-torch-ibm-to-google/</guid><description>Last week the big news was that Google’s AlphaGo was able to win 4 of the 5 games against Lee Sedol in Go.

A typical modern tech startup starts by identifying a problem and using a common web framework to quickly come up with the first pass.

I don’t want to dwell into either of these but something that’s been on my mind is that publishers aren’t doing enough to differentiate themselves based on the quality of their audience.</description></item><item><title>Have a 'go to' project when learning a new programming language</title><link>/2015/10/11/have-a-go-to-project-when-learning-a-new-programming-language/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/10/11/have-a-go-to-project-when-learning-a-new-programming-language/</guid><description>At the beginning of the year I wanted to learn a bit of Node.js and decided the best way was to code up a simple project. The idea was jsonify.me, a simple API only app that provided people a simple way to generate their own JSON profiles that they would then be able to map to any domain name, for example http://json.dangoldin.com. The primary goal was to get some real experience with Node.</description></item><item><title>Not every big company is evil</title><link>/2015/10/10/not-every-big-company-is-evil/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/10/10/not-every-big-company-is-evil/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s become a popular idea that big companies are evil and we should only be supporting small and local businesses. There’s some truth to it - smaller companies are much more aligned with the incentives of the community whereas larger companies may be managed from thousands of miles away via a spreadsheet. When the only goal is to make more money it’s very likely that morality and honesty will suffer.</description></item><item><title>Is media consumption zero sum?</title><link>/2015/10/04/is-media-consumption-zero-sum/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/10/04/is-media-consumption-zero-sum/</guid><description>I’ve seen the point made across a variety of articles that media companies see media consumption as being zero sum - there’s only a fixed amount of consumption that people have and they’re allocating it between a variety of options. The typical example is people abandoning legacy television for YouTube. Thus, the rationale goes, the time people would have spent watching television has been replaced by them watching YouTube.

And at a starting price of $799 it’s significantly cheaper than the Apple laptop options. Apple is known for achieving large product margins but I wonder if the iPad Pro is sold at a lower margin to get people to switch to iOS and get even more tied to Apple’s ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Keep on learning</title><link>/2015/09/20/keep-on-learning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/09/20/keep-on-learning/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a strong believer that one needs to keep learning and to not get content with the knowledge they have.

I noticed three tactics they used to get people to pay fairly and am sure they utilized a bunch more that I didn’t even notice:
Anchoring: Before sitting down to eat the waitress explained that it was pay what you want and most of the dishes are estimated to be priced between $10 and $12.</description></item><item><title>Development cycles across programming languages</title><link>/2015/08/20/development-cycles-across-programming-languages/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/08/20/development-cycles-across-programming-languages/</guid><description>The most common way of making sure code works is by going through the “develop-run-test” loop. We write some code that we expect to have a certain behavior, we run the code and trigger that behavior, and then we confirm that the results are what we expected. And we keep iterating, hopefully making more progress with each new iteration.
One thing I’ve noticed is that this pattern varies drastically for me depending on the language I’m working with.</description></item><item><title>A phoneless day</title><link>/2015/08/16/a-phoneless-day/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/08/16/a-phoneless-day/</guid><description>As they say you don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate something until it&amp;rsquo;s gone and I got to experience first hand when I cracked the screen on my phone and dropped it off for a quick repair.

This makes it possible to create infinite streams since all you need is a function that&amp;rsquo;s able to compute the next value. In such a way we can create a stream of all numbers, just the positive even numbers, or just the prime numbers.</description></item><item><title>Static site search</title><link>/2015/08/09/static-site-search/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/08/09/static-site-search/</guid><description>I’ve written previously about the appeal of static sites and recently came up with another example of how powerful the setup can be. The gist is that the site’s content is static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but the relevant underlying content is refreshed on a recurring basis with a separate job. This allows you to host the entire site on S3 and avoid maintaining your own web server.
Normally, implementing a site search requires a backend to accept queries, break them down into the appropriate keywords, and hit a search index to find the matching documents.</description></item><item><title>It's not done until it's deployed</title><link>/2015/08/01/its-not-done-until-its-deployed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/08/01/its-not-done-until-its-deployed/</guid><description>As a developer, it feels wonderful to commit some code and knock an item off of the ever growing to do list. Unfortunately, until that code is deployed it’s not delivering any actual benefit. It’s easy to open a pull request and move on to the next task but to create high quality products we need to only consider our code complete when it’s deployed and running issue free.

Rather than relying on outdated documentation or discovering undocumented features the database is the actual source of truth and defines both the limits and the capabilities of the application. You can examine the relationships between the various objects as well as the litany of features and options that are supported. It’s definitely more difficult to get up to speed on a database rather than documentation or a demo of the UI but the knowledge gained is significantly deeper.</description></item><item><title>Tunnel vision</title><link>/2015/07/20/tunnel-vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/07/20/tunnel-vision/</guid><description>A common behavior when solving a coding problem is focusing too much on the solution and not enough on the general context. If this is a software problem this may manifest itself as a very quick turnaround on a task that inadvertantly breaks an existing behavior or even something that ends up causing a headache months from now when a slightly more nuanced use case needs to be supported. Experienced developers will not only solve the task at hand but will also understand the limitations of their solution and are able to identify the areas that will be adversely affected by their solution.</description></item><item><title>Excel wins</title><link>/2015/07/19/excel-wins/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/07/19/excel-wins/</guid><description>Other than the usual developer tools the only desktop based app I use is Excel and every few months I try to wean myself away.

In my case the most useful ones are my calendars, both personal and work, the photos I took, and Foursquare/Swarm. As long as I was vigilant in documenting the events it’s simple to figure out what I did. We lose a bit of the mystery when we document our lives and we no longer have long discussions trying to recreate events with friends.</description></item><item><title>Take the first step</title><link>/2015/01/17/take-the-first-step/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/01/17/take-the-first-step/</guid><description>Numerous times I’ve procrastinated on doing something convincing myself that it would either take too long or just wasn’t worth doing but more often than not when I finally take the first step I’m able to quickly complete the task.

On one hand, having many languages provides flexibility in choosing the right language for the job and allows engineers to learn and explore new tools. Better habits are encouraged since the interface between components requires a well structured and tested structure rather than relying on code similarity.</description></item><item><title>A new Turing test</title><link>/2014/12/29/a-new-turing-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/12/29/a-new-turing-test/</guid><description>A friend sent me an article where the author discusses the recent news of an AI finally beating the Turing test and how he himself was clearly able to determine that the AI was not a human.

This happened throughout college on difficult problem sets as well as countless engineering projects at work. Sometimes instead of getting hung up on a tough problem the best thing to do is to forget about it and go for a walk and let the subconscious take over. I don’t know why this works but it seems to be common with others as well.</description></item><item><title>Travel to appreciate technological growth</title><link>/2014/12/13/travel-to-appreciate-technological-growth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/12/13/travel-to-appreciate-technological-growth/</guid><description>If you’re constantly watching something grow it’s hard to notice the magnitude while those further away see it immediately.

It’s a simple, enjoyable read that provides an overview of the modern western economies and offers a compelling explanation of how wealth and income equality occur.

So many startups strive to get an investment and believe that once they raise a round everything will get easier. That’s when things get difficult.

Disqus does a nearly perfect job of flagging them so I don’t understand the motivation behind it. They’re obviously spam and my readers are suave enough to never click on any of the links. There’s also little, possibly none, SEO value since they’re all loaded asynchronously and every link has a rel=”nofollow” property.

The goal is to answer the question of how I’d feel if various services suddenly disappeared.

Many dismiss travel as a luxury but it’s a great way to bring a new perspective and let thoughts settle.</description></item><item><title>Why I manage my own blog</title><link>/2014/02/02/why-i-manage-my-own-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/02/02/why-i-manage-my-own-blog/</guid><description>Given the recent news of Medium raising $25M and Svbtle opening up to the public I thought it would be an appropriate time to explain why I’m not using either of them. They’re both simple, clean products that allow writers to concentrate on their writing rather than configuring the dozens of options available in other blogging platforms. They’ve also done a great job with the typography that makes the content enjoyable to read.</description></item><item><title>Getting a SIM card in India</title><link>/2013/12/23/getting-a-sim-card-in-india/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/12/23/getting-a-sim-card-in-india/</guid><description>I’ve heard about the wonders of an unlocked phone and decided to try it out during my recent trip to India. The idea was to get a cheap unlocked Android phone that I’d be able to use on this and future trips. I was able to get a relatively cheap Samsung phone but it took me a surprisingly long time to get a working SIM card. This post is a description of the steps I took as well as some advice for others trying to do the same.</description></item><item><title>I'm joining TripleLift</title><link>/2013/11/23/im-joining-triplelift/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/11/23/im-joining-triplelift/</guid><description>Just a quick update on my professional life. I recently joined TripleLift’s engineering team. I met the founders while at ERA and liked the problem they were solving. It was also time for me to move on from my other projects so when I found out they were growing it was a pretty easy decision. Being a startup, it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what everyone’s responsibilities are since everyone becomes a generalist but I’ve been focused on the data side.</description></item><item><title>Security in the wake of MongoHQ</title><link>/2013/11/07/security-in-the-wake-of-mongohq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/11/07/security-in-the-wake-of-mongohq/</guid><description>Over the past few days my inbox has been filled with security alert emails caused by the MongoHQ database hack. I’m impressed by the number of customers MongoHQ was able to sign up - they spanned the gamut from sites that I don’t even recall signing up for to startups that have been getting significant buzz.
If a database as a service company is able to get hacked it doesn’t leave me optimistic about the way other companies are securing our data.</description></item><item><title>Lessons from consulting</title><link>/2013/10/27/lessons-from-consulting/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/10/27/lessons-from-consulting/</guid><description>To supplement my income while working on a startup, I took on a few consulting projects and wanted to share some lessons learned. It seems that everyone’s consulting experience is different so consider mine experience as just another data point.

As my friends and I have gotten older, I’ve been hearing it more and more frequently. I’ve even caught myself using when trying to come up with an excuse when coordinating evening or weekend plans.
The reason I dislike the phrase is that it’s equivalent to saying &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not a priority&amp;rdquo; and yet we phrase it such that we convince ourselves it’s something outside our control rather than due to the choices we make.</description></item><item><title>Decline of cynicism</title><link>/2013/10/12/decline-of-cynicism/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/10/12/decline-of-cynicism/</guid><description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten older and most likely more mature, I&amp;rsquo;ve become far less cynical. I used to be dismissive of people trying to improve things and believed that they were just wasting their time and nothing would change. Yet as a I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten older I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate this effort even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t lead to noticeable progress.
The fact that someone is working for their beliefs should be applauded.

Engineers working on quantitative systems or data science clearly require advanced math and there are also countless engineering roles where math is unnecessary. My experience is that even if you don’t use math, having a mathematical mindset makes you significantly more productive. You’re able to quickly estimate the complexity of various tasks and hone your intuition. You’re also able to quickly recognize patterns when refactoring, especially when working in a functional language.</description></item><item><title>Offering suggestions</title><link>/2013/09/16/offering-suggestions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/09/16/offering-suggestions/</guid><description>Since becoming active in the startup scene, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meeting a ton of founders and am annoyed by how much easier it is to offer suggestions than to apply them to myself. My most common suggestion, in true lean startup fashion, is to advocate a quicker or cheaper way to validate the market before building a product and yet it’s extremely difficult to take my own advice. I’ve been working on Better404 on and off for two months now and know I should get it in front of potential customers and yet I keep on making minor tweaks and updates to the product.</description></item><item><title>MoMath visit</title><link>/2013/09/11/momath-visit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/09/11/momath-visit/</guid><description>Although I’ve been meaning to visit the Museum of Math ever since it opened in December, I only got the chance to do it this Labor Day.

For most of human history, people either made what they needed on their own or traded with a local craftsman. Over time, this led to a specialization in skills and also the rise of the apprenticeship model. Since trade was mostly local, it was difficult to build a large business and most businesses were family run with parents passing down skills to their children.</description></item><item><title>Security through monopoly</title><link>/2013/07/22/security-through-monopoly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/07/22/security-through-monopoly/</guid><description>A month ago I needed to duplicate a set of keys.

I worry that it’s going to get increasingly more difficult to build a software startup in the future as large companies develop data monopolies.</description></item><item><title>Meetings: to take or not to take?</title><link>/2013/07/07/meetings-to-take-or-not-to-take/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/07/07/meetings-to-take-or-not-to-take/</guid><description>I struggle with this one. Some days I feel as if I should take every meeting since it’s impossible to know where it can lead. One meeting can completely change a business, generate some consulting work, or lead to new friendships. At the same time, taking every meeting would eat up a chunk of time and most meetings end up fading from memory.
I’m still figuring out my approach but do believe that having fewer, more meaningful relationships is more valuable than having many fleeting ones.</description></item><item><title>Externalizing externalities in brick and mortar</title><link>/2013/07/01/externalizing-externalities-in-brick-and-mortar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/07/01/externalizing-externalities-in-brick-and-mortar/</guid><description>Last week, I had a morning flight out of Laguardia Airport and being into all things tech decided to grab a coffee at a place called Biergarten since they had iPads at every seat.

A big part of it is playing in the grey area between moral and immoral. Do you create fake users and comments to portray an active community? Do you reply to posts on Craigslist trying to get visitors to your site? It’s also much easier to play in this area when you’re a startup - you’re most likely too small to be noticed and even if you are the press won’t spend much time on it.</description></item><item><title>Regulation and the share economy</title><link>/2013/06/16/regulation-and-the-share-economy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/06/16/regulation-and-the-share-economy/</guid><description>The past few years have seen the rise of the share economy with companies such as AirBnB, Sidecar, Lyft, and TaskRabbit seeing massive growth.

Meanwhile, Phil Porter, who had worked with [Richard] Frenkiel on the original system, came up with a permanent answer to an interesting question. Should a cellular phone have a dial tone? Porter made a radical suggestion that it shouldn’t. A caller should dial a number and then push “send.” That way, the mobile caller would be less rushed; also, the call would be connected for a shorter time, thus putting less strain on the network.</description></item><item><title>Coke, Pepsi and Passover</title><link>/2013/04/05/coke-pepsi-and-passover/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/04/05/coke-pepsi-and-passover/</guid><description>During Passover, Coke and Pepsi sell sugar based versions of their sodas in order to stay kosher for Passover.

Newegg recently defended itself against a patent troll that sued them over a shopping cart patent.

Unfortunately, they’ll still keep the tens of millions of dollars they “earned” in earlier years.

Run 1000 miles in 2013 I’ve gotten out of shape over the past couple of months and that’s a bad place to be in the late 20s.</description></item><item><title>Year in Review 2012</title><link>/2013/01/01/year-in-review-2012/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/01/01/year-in-review-2012/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally in a position to do a &amp;ldquo;Year in Review&amp;rdquo; post that I’m comfortable writing. In March I left my full time job to pursue Glossi, our startup, full time. In May, we were accepted into an incubator and had an amazingly productive four months. Unfortunately, none of us were passionate about the direction Glossi was headed and we’ve ended the year pursuing a new venture, Makers Alley.
I learned a ton about myself but along with that came the realization of how much I don&amp;rsquo;t know.</description></item><item><title>The joy of upgrading an HD in a Macbook</title><link>/2012/12/16/the-joy-of-upgrading-an-hd-in-a-macbook/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/12/16/the-joy-of-upgrading-an-hd-in-a-macbook/</guid><description>As a gift to myself I decided to upgrade the RAM and HD in my MacBook. The plan was to replace the old HD with the new one and then use the install disc to install Snow Leopard on the new HD before upgrading to Mountain Lion. Unfortunately, it turned out that I had a bad install disc and had to come up with another approach. The general idea was to upgrade to Mountain Lion first in order to create another boot disc.</description></item><item><title>Entrepreneurship is not a job</title><link>/2012/11/29/entrepreneurship-is-not-a-job/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/11/29/entrepreneurship-is-not-a-job/</guid><description>Let’s start with a joke: An American consultant was at a pier in a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied "Only a little while." The consultant then asked why didn't he stay out longer and catch more fish?</description></item><item><title>Achieving browser autocomplete</title><link>/2012/06/07/achieving-browser-autocomplete/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/06/07/achieving-browser-autocomplete/</guid><description>Over the past few days, I’ve been thinking about habits. How do they form? How do they change? And the selfish one - how can you build a product that is habit forming? My cofunder sent me a great Nir &amp;amp; Far blog post that goes into detail about generating desire which is a great read to anyone building a consumer product.
Along these lines, I decided to be a bit introspective and see which products and sites are a part of my habit.</description></item><item><title>Peter Thiel's CS183</title><link>/2012/05/16/peter-thiels-cs183/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/05/16/peter-thiels-cs183/</guid><description>A great blog I’ve recently started following is Blake Master’s notes from Stanford’s CS183 class being taught by Peter Thiel.

In this post, I want to take a deeper look into why consumers are so much more comfortable with technology now compared to 20 years ago and try to see where this leads. Since customers are what cause our businesses to grow, we need to be cognizant of what drives their behavior in order to plan for the future.</description></item><item><title>On Writing</title><link>/2012/04/04/on-writing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/04/04/on-writing/</guid><description>I recently made an effort to improve my writing and this blog gives me a great way to practice. I force myself to write at least two posts a week, even if it’s just a paragraph. Writing hasn’t come easy to me and I spent more than 20 years returning the favor. In high school, I rarely edited and a quick spell and grammar check was good enough for me. In college, I avoided the writing-heavy classes and the ones I did take I just followed my high school approach.</description></item><item><title>Overcoming the Build Bias</title><link>/2012/03/24/overcoming-the-build-bias/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/03/24/overcoming-the-build-bias/</guid><description>An issue I’ve been trying to overcome is what I like to call the “build bias.” Whenever I’d run into a technical problem, I’d want to solve it on my own - whether it’s by writing some code or by installing and configuring various libraries and packages.

Why not continue working on it nights and weekends?” It’s a fair question - we’ve been working on Glossi for 6 months of nights and weekends and made significant progress. Why not keep doing that and have the best of both worlds?
Everyone has their own reasons but for me it was more of a gut feeling that it was the right time.</description></item><item><title>Shakespeare and Startups</title><link>/2012/01/29/shakespeare-and-startups/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/01/29/shakespeare-and-startups/</guid><description>I was reading Ben Yagoda&amp;#8217;s book, When You Catch An Adjective; Kill It, when I came across the following passage: &amp;#8220;In Shakespeare&amp;#8217;s day, there were no fancy props, so the text had to do the work of stage settings.&amp;#8221; Although it was referring to starting sentences with conjunctions, it got me thinking about constraints and the way they foster innovation.

On one hand, it's great that the online community was able to get GoDaddy to completely reverse their position on SOPA. On the other, it's disappointing that a web company would support it in the first place.
Should we still be penalizing GoDaddy for their initial SOPA support or move on the same way they did? What type of example does this set for other companies?</description></item><item><title>More posts coming soon</title><link>/2010/03/10/more-posts-coming-soon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2010/03/10/more-posts-coming-soon/</guid><description>I will try a new policy - at least one post a week.

This absolves them of responsibility and allows them to stop trying. What they should have done is admitted their failure, learned from the experience, and prepared themselves for the next opportunity. Exposing yourself to opportunities is the best way to overcome bad luck. Authors are a great example of this: J K Rowling and John Grisham had their novels rejected numerous times before they succeeded.</description></item><item><title>More posts coming up</title><link>/2009/01/20/more-posts-coming-up/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2009/01/20/more-posts-coming-up/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy recently but have a bunch of topics that I want to write about so keep on checking.

In addition, competition is well regulated and a shared budget exists. In addition, it looks as if this shared budget is a little over 1% of the Gross National Income of the individual countries (1) - imagine a Federal tax rate of 1%.</description></item><item><title>Voting system proposal</title><link>/2008/09/12/voting-system-proposal/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/09/12/voting-system-proposal/</guid><description>It seems that there is a recent emphasis on "character" in the election. Unfortunately, character can be faked with some acting and campaign management. To understand how the candidates will perform in office we need to look at their past accomplishments and failures. Public records show the vote history for the candidates and all it takes is a little bit of research to see how the candidates have voted.
But people aren't interested in looking at data; they are more interested in how much candidates spend on their haircut or who looks more "</description></item><item><title>On TV commercials</title><link>/2008/09/03/on-tv-commercials/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/09/03/on-tv-commercials/</guid><description>It may be my memory but it seems that TV commericals have been getting longer and longer as compared to a decade ago. It would be very interesting to see a plot of the length of the average commercial break over the past few decades - I think we'll see that the length of the average commercial break has drastically increased.
In addition, it seems as if there are no commerical breaks between consecutive TV shows anymore.</description></item><item><title>Advice on internet passwords</title><link>/2008/06/19/advice-on-internet-passwords/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/06/19/advice-on-internet-passwords/</guid><description>After my previous post on the lack of privacy, I feel obligated to give some advice regarding internet passwords in order to maintain the privacy that we do have.
Have at least 3 different passwords: E-mail Account This account controls all your other accounts so protect it as much as you can. All other accounts can be accessed or reset if someone has access to your email. Bank/Financial Accounts These control your money so use a different password for these than for the rest of your accounts.</description></item><item><title>Privacy in the digital age</title><link>/2008/06/12/privacy-in-the-digital-age/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/06/12/privacy-in-the-digital-age/</guid><description>With so many people joining social networks like Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn, it's becoming harder and harder to protect your personal information. If one of your friends happens to add a host of different facebook apps, those apps will have access to his friends' (your) information. There is nothing you can do to stop this unless you either remove all your friends or create very limited profiles.
In addition, people have come to expect to be able to add you as a friend after they've met you and rejecting them may be construed as anti-social.</description></item><item><title>Don't judge words by their author</title><link>/2008/05/28/dont-judge-words-by-their-author/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/05/28/dont-judge-words-by-their-author/</guid><description>A common idiom is "Don't judge a book by its cover" but I think that in this modern age this needs to rehashed into "Don't judge words by their author."
How often do we look at the author before we read an article or blog post? And how does this impact the way we absorb it? Studies have been done[1] to show that the same words coming from two different people, one a professor and one an average Joe, are interpreted differently: the professor is trusted while the average Joe is not.</description></item><item><title>Welcome</title><link>/2008/05/21/welcome/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/05/21/welcome/</guid><description>So I am porting this blog over from wordpress.com to my own local hosting.

You can make the same argument for any part of the interview process and I feel that brainteasers may even attract intelligent employees.
I can come up with a few good reasons to use brainteasers during an interview. One, you are able to determine how well the interviewee thinks as well as their problem solving ability.</description></item><item><title>Printers no longer come with cables?</title><link>/2008/05/13/printers-no-longer-come-with-cables/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/05/13/printers-no-longer-come-with-cables/</guid><description>Since when did printers stop coming with the cables? Does this have anything to do with printers being available in USB form and the manufacturers suddenly assuming that everyone already has USB cables? Or is it some agreement that they have with merchants that requires me to pay $20 for a 6' cable. Some quick price look ups do show that the standard printer cables cost around the same as USB cables so if they were able to afford to bundle printer cables before USB, they should be able to bundle USB cables now.</description></item><item><title>Why we may never colonize space</title><link>/2008/05/13/why-we-may-never-colonize-space/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/05/13/why-we-may-never-colonize-space/</guid><description>Although it&amp;rsquo;s wonderful to think that we will be able to colonize other worlds when we grow too numerous or run out of resources, it may not happen.

In order to go into space we would need to have an advanced level of technology which could only be created through innovation.</description></item><item><title>Pronunciation</title><link>/2008/05/08/pronunciation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/05/08/pronunciation/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered a few words where I know the definition and spelling but I don&amp;rsquo;t know the pronunciation. The problem is that I think I know how to pronounce them so when I use them for the first time in conversation, or hear someone using them, some confusion arises (as well as making me look like a fool).

Each one of the homeless may start committing some type of crime in order to get into prison and at least not worry about where their next meal comes from yet they are staying on the streets as free men.

They are creative endeavors that take as much and as long to make as some movies. There is also a huge distinction between the great and the poor games. Games these days can be considered movies and they should be treated in the same way.
Maybe then will video games no longer be the black sheep of the media and entertainment business.</description></item></channel></rss>
