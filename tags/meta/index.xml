Years ago I redesigned my entire site to use AMP across all devices, powered by Jekyll, and hosted on GitHub pages. At the end of 2020 I decided I was ready to abandon AMP and move toward a more traditional and straightforward setup while leveraging a more modern toolchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to my adoption of AMP my Jekyll/GitHub Pages setup was highly custom. I had to build it locally and push the rendered version to GitHub since I had custom ruby scripts handling a lot of the AMP conversions. In addition, I had to resort to a variety of workarounds to get Disqus working within AMP. Also, since AMP inlines all the CSS the build took almost 8 seconds despite being highly optimized and running a pretty powerful computer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2021 goals</title><link>/2020/12/29/2021-goals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/29/2021-goals/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite 2020 showing us how unpredictable the world can be, it&amp;rsquo;s that wonderful time of the year when everyone comes up with goals for the upcoming year. On one hand it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to predict what will happen but on the other hand it is useful to give some sense of purpose and direction. Being thoughtful and public around our goals is also a way to encourage us to commit and see them through completion. I &lt;a href="/2020/12/21/2020-goal-review/">didn&amp;rsquo;t do so well&lt;/a> with my 2020 goals but even the process of generating them was useful to help me understand where I am and what I&amp;rsquo;m interested in. For 2021 I&amp;rsquo;m adopting a similar approach but rather than get too specific I want to think more thematically and use 2021 to recover from the bad habits introduced in 2020.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Time to remove AMP from my blog</title><link>/2020/12/29/time-to-remove-amp-from-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/29/time-to-remove-amp-from-my-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few years ago I redid this entire blog to use AMP - not just for mobile but also for desktop. The motivation was to improve the performance while scratching my curiosity itch. It was a fun experiment but these days I&amp;rsquo;m more averse to Google&amp;rsquo;s dominance and think I can do even better by taking what I liked from AMP but going even simpler. It took quite a bit of work to get everything working the way I wanted to in AMP - for example converting AMP markup into a valid RSS feed and getting Disqus working - and while it&amp;rsquo;ll be a shame to undo all that work it feels like the right time. The current deployment is custom Jekyll on top of GitHub Pages but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to simplify the entire workflow and take advantage of some of the modern tools - for example GitHub Actions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blogging: 2020 and beyond</title><link>/2020/12/28/blogging-2020-and-beyond/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/28/blogging-2020-and-beyond/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have a &lt;a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/blog-analytics/">script&lt;/a> I use to analyze and visualize my blogging.

Another script does some simple visualizations.

A big part was having the same name as the head of NASA, Daniel Goldin, where I harbored illusions that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have to change the nameplate on the door. My parents supported this interest and got me subscriptions to a variety of space and science magazines. I did not go the space route but despite that I&amp;rsquo;m sure that passion and curiosity contributed to my growth and I still have a soft spot for space.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2020 donations</title><link>/2020/12/26/2020-donations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/26/2020-donations/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year I wrote a &lt;a href="/2019/12/17/2019-donations/">short post&lt;/a> highlighting my donations with the hope that they encourage others to donate.

&lt;p>I continued my donations from last year and donated to the EFF, ACLU, Wikipedia, and Planned Parenthood for the &lt;a href="/2019/12/17/2019-donations/">same reasons&lt;/a> as last year. The additions this year have been a function of everything that&amp;rsquo;s happened.

The year was a tough one for most people but all things considered I&amp;rsquo;m in a privileged position and can&amp;rsquo;t blame COVID too much. For sure there were periods of ennui but the root was that I just lost interest and motivation in some of these.

Instead it supposedly prioritized senior administrators who are working from home. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s some truth to the algorithm biasing allocation to those who are older but whenever I see someone blame an algorithm my spidey-sense goes off. The algorithm in this case was likely some extremely simple calculation in Excel that could have been easily verified by a human - both before it was run as well as a quick analysis of the results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Impact of getting to the top of Hacker News in 2020</title><link>/2020/12/13/impact-of-getting-to-the-top-of-hacker-news-in-2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/13/impact-of-getting-to-the-top-of-hacker-news-in-2020/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two days ago I wrote up a quick &lt;a href="/2020/12/11/amazon-owns-more-than-2b-worth-of-ipv4-addresses/">post&lt;/a> highlighting how Amazon owns more than $2B domains and it struck a nerve. It&amp;rsquo;s been shared quite a bit on Twitter and I posted it to Hacker News on Friday night before going to bed to wake up to it being near the top which drove a ton of views. It&amp;rsquo;s always a surprise seeing what takes off but there&amp;rsquo;s something about Amazon owning billions of dollars in domains that&amp;rsquo;s shocking and gets people riled up.

It&amp;rsquo;s given many of us a starting set of tools that allowed us to quickly put together new products and allowed us to specialize. These days open source is as strong as ever but there are a lot of changes happening on the licensing side. Under the older open source licenses, any company could take your code and then launch it as their own service. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem in the past due to a highly fragmented market and trusting the developer to provide the gold-standard enterprise service but the rise of the cloud providers changed the dynamic. They have the scale to both build the expertise but also to lock-in customers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pay to enjoy video games</title><link>/2020/12/08/pay-to-enjoy-video-games/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/08/pay-to-enjoy-video-games/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a kid I was incredibly addicted to video games. I had a whole cat-and-mouse routine going on with my parents. They would put a BIOS boot password on the computer and I would open up the case, remove the battery, and reset the BIOS settings. They would lock the basement, where our one and only computer was located, and I would climb in through the window. They would lock the door to the computer room and I would undo the door hinges. It was difficult stopping me but remarkably I outgrew them and am now a somewhat well-adjusted member of society.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Subconciously learning to type Russian</title><link>/2020/11/22/subconciously-learning-to-type-russian/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/11/22/subconciously-learning-to-type-russian/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was born in the Soviet Union, came over as a 5 year old, and have seen my Russian getting worse and worse due to a lack of exposure. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using quarantine as a way to practice and improve my Russian through daily lessons in the Duolingo app. It&amp;rsquo;s a well designed app and while it has some flaws I&amp;rsquo;m on a 191 day streak and am loath to give it up. One thing that&amp;rsquo;s surprised me was how I&amp;rsquo;ve subconsciously picked up the Russian keyboard layout. I started having to hunt for each letter but these days have a subconscious feel for where the letters are. I actually do a better job typing without any thought than trying to figure out what letter comes next and where it is.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cursed by GDPR</title><link>/2020/11/20/cursed-by-gdpr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/11/20/cursed-by-gdpr/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had a fun little experience over the past few days.

&lt;p>Lo and behold the unsubscribe link didn&amp;rsquo;t work.

I don&amp;rsquo;t know how this plays out but my inbox is already overwhelmed and having more longish-form content to go through just won&amp;rsquo;t happen. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting space that&amp;rsquo;s changing quickly and will look very different in a few years. Many seem to think that there&amp;rsquo;s a huge opportunity here for authors to build a niche audience that&amp;rsquo;s able to sustain their writing but i&amp;rsquo;m not wholly convinced. If you&amp;rsquo;re able to get the best of the best does it make sense to go for the second tier? Some people may want that additional depth but the majority will be happy with the highly skilled writer covering a broad topic. These will be the small number of authors who amass huge audiences and capture the majority of the revenue while the rest will be focused on niche topics with enough of an audience to keep them going. Inevitably, these &amp;ldquo;tail&amp;rdquo; writers will band together and offer their newsletters as a bundle. What&amp;rsquo;s old is new and we will see the rebirth of newspapers and magazines.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cold turkey and fighting temptations</title><link>/2020/09/22/cold-turkey-and-fighting-temptations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/09/22/cold-turkey-and-fighting-temptations/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some people are able to control urges but I&amp;rsquo;m much better off just removing the objects of desire entirely.

Somewhere in between is the group view provided by Google Calendar. I&amp;rsquo;m often in there and it turns out to be a pretty quick way of getting the list of all the users in a group without having to have anything open in another tab. One of the best parts is that it gives you the ability to expand and dedup group memberships which is great for dealing with nested groups - such as sub teams.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Back to Mac</title><link>/2020/08/24/back-to-mac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/08/24/back-to-mac/</guid><description>&lt;p>After almost 2 years of Ubuntu I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to a Mac.

I grew up a native Russian speaker which has unfortunately eroded over the years and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past few months improving my Russian through Duolingo. It&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly effective app and has enough gamification to keep me going. My approach has been to just take the tests to skip out of lessons until I master every lesson. It started off easy but I&amp;rsquo;m now failing to advance about 20% of the time. Some of these are very much due to Russian specific issues - namely the fact that very often you can change the order of words in Russian without affecting the translation which Duolingo doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to handle well. Yet to keep things fun I&amp;rsquo;ve been screenshotting amusing translations and thought I&amp;rsquo;d share the best ones here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software defined photography</title><link>/2020/06/15/software-defined-photography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/06/15/software-defined-photography/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was talking to a coworker earlier today about the ridiculous quality of today&amp;rsquo;s smartphone cameras.

The explanation is that AlphaGo doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about the margin of victory, just the victory itself. It&amp;rsquo;s trying to maximize the likelihood of winning, not the score differential - and that leads to a unique playing style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found this part of the documentary fascinating as it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that&amp;rsquo;s obvious when explained but you&amp;rsquo;d never stop to think about. Humans rarely think about margin of victory. Most of our decisions and competitions aren&amp;rsquo;t quantifiable so we always try to do the best we can. In sports, on the other hand, where there are actual scores, teams will play for the victory rather than the score. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to think of decisions in our daily lives that would benefit from shifting from margin-of-victory thinking to the victory itself. It&amp;rsquo;s not natural and being able to challenge human nature is a valuable skill.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google and Apple's COVID tracking project</title><link>/2020/04/18/google-and-apples-covid-tracking-project/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/04/18/google-and-apples-covid-tracking-project/</guid><description>&lt;p>Google and Apple recently announced a partnership to help people anonymously see if they&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to someone with COVID.

&lt;p>I think the opposite. I believe that with enough marketing this will be a massive success. Over and over again we&amp;rsquo;ve seen that most people do not value privacy and this will be no different. In fact, for this case it may just be the opposite - most people would love to know the answer to &amp;ldquo;is there a chance I have Coronavirus.&amp;rdquo; Curiosity, one of our greatest traits, will be enough to overcome whatever privacy concerns people have.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Disabling TabNine to improve Ubuntu performance</title><link>/2020/03/29/disabling-tabnine-to-improve-ubuntu-performance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/03/29/disabling-tabnine-to-improve-ubuntu-performance/</guid><description>&lt;p>At the end of 2018 I switched from using a Mac to using Ubuntu on a ThinkPad.

More importantly, and this is pure speculation, it seems as if you pick a random person and look at their social network usage it&amp;rsquo;s very likely they&amp;rsquo;re spending the majority, if not all of their time, in only one of those networks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Farewell 2019, hello 2020</title><link>/2019/12/31/farewell-2019-hello-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/31/farewell-2019-hello-2020/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bill Gates once said &amp;ldquo;Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s a good assessment of my decade.

This is leading to a variety of companies that are building kitchens that can be rented out by these types of restaurants. In fact, one of them, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudkitchens.com/">CloudKitchens&lt;/a>, is Travis Kalanick new startup attempt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that these businesses depend on food delivery platforms and they don&amp;rsquo;t actually have a retail location I wonder if these restaurants are creating multiple listings on these platforms. This gives them another spot in the search results and allows them to crowd out their competitors. Of course, each would have a reduced number of orders and thus show up lower in the results but it still feels as if there&amp;rsquo;s potential for some gaming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zappos customer service</title><link>/2019/12/30/zappos-customer-service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/30/zappos-customer-service/</guid><description>&lt;p>The outcome of the Zappos class action settlement was 10% of an order that needs to be made by January 2020.

Maybe it’s due to the slower typing speed, the lack of distraction, the novelty, or just self-deception but it feels as if some of my previous rough drafts have had both more interesting thoughts, analogies, and wordsmithing. For example, &lt;a href="http://dangoldin.com/2019/12/23/iphone-11-battery/">comparing the poor battery life&lt;/a> of my previous phone to checking out at a car&amp;rsquo;s gas tank before a trip or titling a post &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://dangoldin.com/2019/12/24/write-mobile-edit-desktop/">Write mobile, edit desktop&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know if I would have been able to do that if I were on my laptop but it really does seem as if the new environment had something to do with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Write mobile, edit desktop</title><link>/2019/12/24/write-mobile-edit-desktop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/24/write-mobile-edit-desktop/</guid><description>&lt;p>Similar to last year I&amp;rsquo;m behind on my blogging and need to write a dozen more posts in the next week to hit my annual blogging goal of two a week.

&lt;p>My 6S couldn’t last a few hours of limited usage without running out of power. Similar to how someone will look at their gas tank before leaving on a trip I was doing the same for my phone’s battery charge any time I&amp;rsquo;d be away from a charger. It’s a surprisingly stressful and not healthy way to be and sadly highlights our dependence on always being connected.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DeAMPifying my blog</title><link>/2019/12/21/deampifying-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/21/deampifying-my-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since &lt;a href="http://dangoldin.com/2016/09/05/ampifying-my-blog/">September of 2016&lt;/a> this blog has been exclusively (both mobile and desktop) in &lt;a href="https://amp.dev/">AMP&lt;/a>.

It&amp;rsquo;s likely a case of the grass being greener but hardware feels like a whole new exciting world compared to software. Rather than dealing with the abstract world of software it&amp;rsquo;s dealing with the real world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above article is an unfair one to use since anything related to space is going to be extra exciting but it highlights the depth and creativity necessary to work in hardware. Even in the 80s and 90s a software engineer needed to have a decent grasp of the underlying hardware to be productive. This is no longer the case. One can go through a career without understanding how computers actually work behind the scenes. That&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing: the field is so wild with so much specialization that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to have a good grasp of everything and we have to pick what we want to master.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2019 donations</title><link>/2019/12/17/2019-donations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/17/2019-donations/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year where I make my annual donations. I&amp;rsquo;ve settled on a core set of foundations and charities that I donate to but occasionally have an outlier depending on what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the world and this year was no different.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF&lt;/a>. Being in technology I&amp;rsquo;m more aware than most of the perils of technology and the EFF is at the forefront of defending digital privacy and rights in a constantly threatened world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU&lt;/a>. Similar to the EFF but focused more broadly on all rights. Especially these days it&amp;rsquo;s critical to challenge unfair laws and fight for the bill of rights.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/">Wikipedia&lt;/a>. I can&amp;rsquo;t live without Wikipedia and use it all the time so it&amp;rsquo;s only fair that I donate some to keep it going.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that we live in a world where Planned Parenthood even exists but until the day it&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary I&amp;rsquo;ll keep on donating. It provides incredibly valuable healthcare to remote areas and there are countless stories of them saving lives by being the only resource in a location.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://amymcgrath.com/">Amy McGrath&lt;/a>. I try to stay away from politics but the current state makes me feel negligent not donating. Amy is running for the Kentucky senate seat against Mitch McConnell. So many of today&amp;rsquo;s problems can be attributed to McConnell and the sooner he&amp;rsquo;s out of office the sooner the United States can get back on track.&lt;/li>

One of the most common refrains was that to be more efficient one had to do everything with the keyboard: no mouse allowed. The idea here that keyboard shortcuts are going to be much faster than navigating menus with a mouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don’t hear this too often in software engineering but it applies just as much. Nearly every tool we use can be controlled via shortcuts yet too often we&amp;rsquo;re gravitating towards the mouse. Keyboard shortcuts aren&amp;rsquo;t intuitive and it takes time to get the muscle memory down but it&amp;rsquo;s all worth it once it&amp;rsquo;s mastered. It&amp;rsquo;s incredible seeing people work who have this level of mastery - it&amp;rsquo;s akin to watching piano virtuosos performing complex symphonies. Even if we don&amp;rsquo;t get to that level nearly anyone can benefit from at least having the basic shortcuts down. Superhuman is an incredibly successful product and a big part is the focus on making users more efficient through clever and powerful shortcuts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2019 Predictions in review</title><link>/2019/12/12/2019-predictions-in-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/12/2019-predictions-in-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>At the end of 2018 I made &lt;a href="http://dangoldin.com/2018/12/31/2019-predictions/">four predictions for 2019&lt;/a> and now that we&amp;rsquo;re nearing the end of the year it&amp;rsquo;s time to see how accurate they were.

The code usually starts clean, elegant, and simple but inevitably grows in complexity. The challenge is to manage that growing complexity. My approach is to strive to make that complexity linear rather than multiplicative. A multiplicative approach is one where a new requirement forces you to think through other parts of your code and determine what needs to change. A linear approach is one where this additional requirement forces you to think through others in its class but not much beyond that. A simple way to visualize the difference is through if statements. A codebase with multiplicative complexity has a ton of nested ifs where writing new code requires you to understand each of the other if-else branches. A linear complexity codebase would still require you to think through a new behavior but the complexity would be limited to a flat if block.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solve categories, not individual problems</title><link>/2019/12/10/solve-categories-not-individual-problems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/10/solve-categories-not-individual-problems/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the most valuable abilities in modern software development is the ability to solve entire categories of issues instead of the immediate problem in front of us.

&lt;p>It came with a built in solver and an algebraic manipulation library which made solving all sorts of problems a breeze.

I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the shell and believe it&amp;rsquo;s underutilized by most engineers yet I can&amp;rsquo;t get over the fact that a query still takes 12 hours to run. I have very little context around the data, the query, or the join but my approach would be to see if there&amp;rsquo;s a different toolset to solve the problem. Running a 12 hour query is dangerous - a disruption will require the query to be run from scratch and the affected tables are locked for that amount of time. It&amp;rsquo;s likely the case that this project doesn&amp;rsquo;t need anything better but even then there should be ways of improving the approach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Computer history memos</title><link>/2019/10/29/computer-history-memos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/10/29/computer-history-memos/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of tech industry history and came across a neat trove of &lt;a href="https://sriramk.com/memos">memos&lt;/a> compiled by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sriramk">Sriram Krishnan&lt;/a>.

In hindsight I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised but did feel a bit misled since DoorDash has separate service and delivery that I figured covered the actual service. After I overcame the feeling of being tricked I thought it would be interesting to see how whether other delivery services are doing the same thing and by how much. I looked at the items I ordered across DoorDash, UberEats, and Seamless/GrubHub. Solely looking at the prices it looks as if DoorDash has the highest markup, followed up UberEats, and then Seamless/GrubHub.

It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to hurt a country economically to drive change but a whole other to prevent their population from accessing information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Totalitarian countries want to control access to information and the way to fight that is to make it as easy as possible to make it available and this move is the exact opposite of what should happen. GitHub does an incredible job of making information accessible and that should be encouraged. Major changes come from people pushing back against existing authority and they need to have hope to do so. Providing a glimpse of another world is how we do that and it&amp;rsquo;s disappointing that this avenue is being shut down.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Ubuntu experinece</title><link>/2019/07/14/my-ubuntu-experinece/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/14/my-ubuntu-experinece/</guid><description>&lt;p>At the end of 2018 I made the shift from OS X on a Macbook Pro to Ubuntu on a Thinkpad and it&amp;rsquo;s been enough time for me to get used to the new setup while still remember the old one so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The good&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Installing packages is much easier and requires no weird workarounds. The built-in package manager is a big boost and nearly every library or utility I need can be installed with a simple &amp;ldquo;apt install&amp;rdquo; call. As expected, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more customization you can do than on OS X. Nearly everything can be tweaked and modified - ranging from shortcuts in different apps to various system settings to get the optimal configuration. Developing feels similar to OS X in terms of IDEs but it does feel a little bit snappier and the environment is much closer to where it will actually be deployed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Personal dashboards</title><link>/2019/07/10/personal-dashboards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/10/personal-dashboards/</guid><description>&lt;p>They say you don&amp;rsquo;t improve what you don&amp;rsquo;t measure and there are a ton of things I want to improve about myself!

&lt;p>What if we each had our own personal dashboard that measured what was important to us? There are obvious ones such as health and sleep metrics but there can also be a ton based on productivity or life in general.

For life it can be about how much time we&amp;rsquo;re spending with our families and friends or just pursuing hobbies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Power of habit</title><link>/2019/07/08/power-of-habit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/08/power-of-habit/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year I feel behind my writing and had to scramble starting in November to hit my goal of two blog posts a week. I unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t start this year strong and am already behind. In the first half of the year I should have written 52 posts but I&amp;rsquo;m currently at 24, just under half off the goal. This is not great if I want to have a somewhat normal November and December where I&amp;rsquo;m not spending nearly every free moment of the day writing so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a post every day in July in order to eat into the debt.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revamping my online security</title><link>/2019/07/03/revamping-my-online-security/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/03/revamping-my-online-security/</guid><description>&lt;p>Out of curiosity I checked out &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned&lt;/a> to see if my data was exposed in any breach and it turns out my email was found in 22 breaches. I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised - I&amp;rsquo;m probably registered on hundreds, if not thousands, of sites and it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before some of them get compromised. You should assume that every time you register for a site that data will get leaked and act accordingly - this means using a unique password on every site and, if possible, even obfuscating your email address. For the past year and a half I&amp;rsquo;ve embraced the approach of assuming my email address is public but investing heavily in strong, secure, and randomly generated passwords that are unique to every site. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been slowly going through my older registrations and updating the passwords.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Patents and Patent Law</title><link>/2019/05/04/patents-and-patent-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/05/04/patents-and-patent-law/</guid><description>&lt;p>Less than half of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Genius-Edwin-Polaroid-Patent/dp/1627227695">A Triumph of Genius: Edwin Land, Polaroid, and the Kodak Patent War&lt;/a> is spent on the biography of Edwin Land. Rather, the majority of the book is spent on the details of the 7 year Polaroid/Kodak lawsuit. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an appreciation for the complexity of patent law until reading the book. It&amp;rsquo;s both incredibly dry but also incredibly fascinating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patents and patent law are critical to innovation but the entire legal process of a patent lawsuit is fascinating and dangerous. Experts spend time designing solutions that are then patented. And then it is up to lawyers and judges to determine whether these patents were legitimate. There&amp;rsquo;s so much nuance and complexity that needs to be explained that it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that the majority of patent lawsuits end up settling - neither side wants to bet on a subjective outcome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Free as in puppy</title><link>/2019/04/23/free-as-in-puppy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/04/23/free-as-in-puppy/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve known about &amp;ldquo;free as in beer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;free as in speech&amp;rdquo; for a while now but only recently have I learned about &amp;ldquo;free as in puppy.&amp;rdquo; I came across the phrase while reading a &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-regulatory-framework-for-the-internet/">Stratechery article&lt;/a> describing various ways of thinking about regulation. The idea is that just like getting a free puppy, you get it for free but it comes with a significant long term cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the phrase and it highlights a very common tradeoff we make, especially in engineering. We often get carried away solving a problem but fail to consider the long term cost of maintenance and support. By the time we discover these long term costs the product is entrenched and we&amp;rsquo;re on the hook for maintaining it in its current form. It&amp;rsquo;s important to slow down and realize that nearly all software we write is in the &amp;ldquo;free as in puppy&amp;rdquo; camp. Writing the code to work is the easy part - writing it to work with no ongoing cost is the challenge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>YouTube's popularity</title><link>/2019/03/22/youtubes-popularity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/03/22/youtubes-popularity/</guid><description>&lt;p>I know YouTube is huge but it’s amazing how small of a role it plays in my life. The statistics make it seem as if nearly every person online is addicted to YouTube and yet I barely use it. The extent of my YouTube experience is watching how-to videos whenever I need to do something around the house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most recent time I watched YouTube was a directed search for a how to video on how to disassemble and unclog a bathtub drain. Beyond that I can’t recall the last time I watched a YouTube video.

The length and depth of my blog posts has definitely declined over the past 2 months but it was refreshing being forced to write about whatever came to mind.

It was my first time in both Mexico and Mexico City but it was a great city with a ton of things to do and very helpful people. We’re all products of our experience and can’t help but compare the places we visit against the places we live. New York City and Mexico City have a lot in common: they’re both large modern cities with robust infrastructure and all the modern “millennial amenities” including ride sharing, bike sharing, various food delivery services, and a ton of bars and restaurants. In fact Mexico City also has electric scooters which still haven’t made it into NYC.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving from OS X to Ubuntu</title><link>/2018/12/29/moving-from-os-x-to-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/29/moving-from-os-x-to-ubuntu/</guid><description>&lt;p>It gets easier and easier to set up a new computer.

These days it’s incredibly simple: most of our digital lives are replicated somewhere online and local files can be kept in Dropbox while code is kept on GitHub. I migrated from OS X to Ubuntu and the vast majority of the issues I’m running into are keyboard shortcut and workflow related and nothing to do with the software itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eerie blue NYC sky</title><link>/2018/12/27/eerie-blue-nyc-sky/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/27/eerie-blue-nyc-sky/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;amp-youtube data-videoid="6G4dYRcKnVE" layout="responsive" width="640" height="480">&lt;/amp-youtube>&lt;/p>

It makes you both appreciate and fear about the modern world - the technologies and cities we have are so complex and modern that an explosion led the night sky to glow blue for more than a minute. I didn’t even realize there was anything powerful enough to make the night sky glow that bright for that long but apparently we’re surrounded by that potential.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualizing my blog: 2018 edition</title><link>/2018/12/26/visualizing-my-blog-2018-edition/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/26/visualizing-my-blog-2018-edition/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year I came up with a set of scripts to analyze my blog and thought it would be interesting to rerun them this year to see what&amp;rsquo;s changed.

They appeal to both my sense of organization and efficiency but also to the actual depth of the technical implementation. It’s not easy creating a good calendar application - you have to think about all sorts of edge cases - for example rescheduling an event that was part of a recurring series or the usual time zone nonsense. A thought I keep going back to is treating calendars as event streams. Right now I have a personal calendar as well as a few others that are shared with different groups. Using code it’s possible to collect the events across these calendars and then apply various operations on top of them - find events that overlap, find people that overlap, analyze the event frequencies, etc but this has to be done through very specific logic. I love the idea of calendars just consistent of event streams. That way you can apply transformations on top of the streams to answer any questions you have. I imagine this to be a form of lazy list expression or even something like a SQL query that would allow me to take all the events I have going on and apply a map/reduce like operation to get what I need. This still feels a bit abstract and I need to flesh out the idea a bit more but I feel there’s something here - just being able to treat your calendar as a single stream and provide a simple way to act on top of them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solve all web app performance problems with SQL</title><link>/2018/12/24/solve-all-web-app-performance-problems-with-sql/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/24/solve-all-web-app-performance-problems-with-sql/</guid><description>&lt;p>The title is clearly tongue in cheek but a very large number of web application issues can be solved through better SQL. Web applications performance problems are either UI or API related. And if the performance is on the API side it&amp;rsquo;s likely due to slow queries. The majority of endpoints are doing some form of database interaction and many are making multiple database calls. It only takes one of these to be slow to make the entire application feel sluggish - especially if you have lots of concurrent requests to this endpoint. This often happens when you rely on an ORM to manage your database reads and writes without understanding the queries that are actually being made. An ORM makes it much easier to get started but to get the best performance you need to go lower level and write your own queries. The way to dig into these is to look at the slow query log which gives you (at least in MySQL) both the query, the duration, and the amount of rows examined and sent. Sorting by the query duration gives you a the worst performing queries and then it’s up to you to address them. Sometimes it’s adding a few indices to a table. Other times it’s rewriting the query to be more efficient. Even more rarely it highlights a weakness in the application logic that requires rethinking a particular approach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Edge moving to Chromium</title><link>/2018/12/22/edge-moving-to-chromium/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/22/edge-moving-to-chromium/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m a bit late to the party but it’s unbelievable that Microsoft is going to &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10">move future versions&lt;/a> of Edge to be built on top of Chromium. This is shocking. I can’t separate Internet Explorer from Microsoft. In fact, Microsoft built, launched, and bundled Internet Explorer to drive Netscape into the ground which led to the famous Microsoft &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.">antitrust case&lt;/a>. It feels as if Microsoft is giving up on Internet Explorer and it’s incredibly surprising. This is bigger than any of the other moves Microsoft has done to show they are a very different company. This is more significant than the GitHub acquisition. This is more significant than supporting their applications on operating systems other than windows. This is moving away from 20 years of history and it shows how different the current Microsoft is from the one of the past. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when this decision was discussed - there must have been so much passion in that room. There must have been so many viewpoints: ranging from those that have been working on IE for the past 20 years, to the product team that&amp;rsquo;s responsible for the future of IE, to the executive team that needed to make the call. It really is surprising that they had the strength and conviction to be able to acknowledge that they&amp;rsquo;d be better off using Chromium.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HackerRank</title><link>/2018/12/22/hackerrank/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/22/hackerrank/</guid><description>&lt;p>These days I rarely code during work since there’s other work to be done but I miss it.

&lt;p>My modern equivalent is global roaming. I have T-Mobile which offers free global roaming as part of their standard plan and it’s amazing being able to travel that way. So much of the modern world’s amenities depend on being online at any time that I can’t imagine traveling without it. Using Uber or Lyft would be significantly more difficult. Same for the electric scooter rental apps that require scanning a QR code. Or just being able to quickly look up your location to figure out where you are and how to get to your destination.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tech startups are not the only ones taking risks</title><link>/2018/12/20/tech-startups-are-not-the-only-ones-taking-risks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/20/tech-startups-are-not-the-only-ones-taking-risks/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post has been sitting on my to-write list for multiple years now but it’s a topic I’ve been meaning to write ever since my Makers Alley experience.

&lt;p>I couldn’t help but think back to the 19th century where companies were large enough to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_town">own&lt;/a> all the property in a town and have their employees live there. As one can imagine it was extremely exploitative since you had the company that paid you also collect money from you for your housing.

It may feel as if you’re admitting defeat and giving up but that break gives you the respite that is necessary to find the passive inspiration to solve a problem. People say that they often have the best ideas in the shower - in fact Archimedes supposedly found his “Eureka” moment in the bathtub - but I get my moment of inspiration when I’m either waking up, falling asleep, or doodling.

&lt;p>This, then, is the state of technology in 2018: the enterprise market is thriving, and the consumer market is stagnant, dominated by the “innovations” that a few large behemoths deign to develop for consumers (probably by ripping off a smaller company).

It makes sense that GitHub is significantly cheaper since it’s fundamentally just git hosting and it has virtually zero marginal costs to support new customers. AWS on the other hand is bills entirely based on usage and has to allocate the additional hardware for every customer and is definitely not zero marginal cost. Yet they’re both integral in the modern tech ecosystem and are used extensively by companies and startups.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Avoiding content overload</title><link>/2018/12/09/avoiding-content-overload/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/09/avoiding-content-overload/</guid><description>&lt;p>While going through my list of blog post ideas I found one from a few years ago titled “Content Overload” which was meant to highlight how much content I was bombarded with across a variety of channels. I had a bunch of thoughts bemoaning how difficult it was to keep up but these days it’s just not an issue for me. I’m no longer trying to consume everything I can and instead get a lot of my news from conversations with friends and coworkers as well as Twitter. I try to check in on Hacker News every day but occasionally go on stretches where I forget about it for a few days and no one’s the wiser. I sadly gave up on my RSS feed and stopped checking into the other aggregators. Important news will inevitably make its way to me and the less important news I enjoy finding serendipitously. I wouldn’t be surprised if my content consumption actually dropped over the past few years. I’m reading many more books now and am okay with just not keeping up with everything. The one digital content channel that has gotten stronger is email: I’ll subscribe to interesting newsletters and prune these aggressively to make sure my email stays clean and high signal.

From the caller’s experience the two are indistinguishable since you’re just using your voice but on the restaurant side there’s no need to talk to someone to do something that can be done through a series of API calls. The calling approach is incredibly impressive and makes sense when a business doesn’t offer any online booking functionality but many do and involving a person introduces overhead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conference call echoes</title><link>/2018/12/06/conference-call-echoes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/06/conference-call-echoes/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m sure conference calls have improved significantly over the past decade yet they still feel incredibly behind.

Whenever there are two unmuted people in a single room dialed in to the same meeting you hear the effect. As soon as one speaks you hear loud and whiny static that only goes away when one of the participants mutes themselves. The solution is incredibly simple and it’s shocking that there’s no automated solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The golden age of browsers</title><link>/2018/12/05/the-golden-age-of-browsers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/05/the-golden-age-of-browsers/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/browser-share.png" alt="Browser market share June 2018" data-width="1248" data-height="1112" data-layout="responsive" />

&lt;p>In June 2018 the top 5 browsers had an estimated 94.98% share of the browser market. This makes sense since most people either use their OS’s default browser or find a mainstream alternative, such as Chrome or Firefox. Yet there’s a lot of interesting and novel browser work happening on the fringes. &lt;a href="https://brave.com">Brave&lt;/a>, started by Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript and cofounder of the Mozilla project), is designed for privacy and comes with built-in adblocking; &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi&lt;/a> is all about customization and tab management; &lt;a href="http://www.ucweb.com">UC Browser&lt;/a> is all about mobile performance - and is, in fact, the third most popular mobile browser.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How many wifi devices do we have?</title><link>/2018/12/04/how-many-wifi-devices-do-we-have/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/04/how-many-wifi-devices-do-we-have/</guid><description>&lt;p>Benedict Evans wrote a &lt;a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/5/26/the-internet-of-things">great post&lt;/a> back in 2014 that started with the observation that while our grandparents knew how many motors they owned we have no idea and that while we know how many of our devices connect to the internet our children will not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It sounded nice at the time but I lived it today. Verizon sent me a new router and rather than taking the small amount of time to change the wifi network name and password back to the previous version I decided it wouldn’t be that hard to just update the wifi settings in the various devices. After I updated my phone, computer, and Fire TV Stick I realized I still had many more to go and decided, albeit too late, that it would be easier to just revert the settings. What makes changing the settings difficult is that updating the wifi settings on devices without a keyboard is just incredibly difficult. For some, such as the Fire TV Stick, you have to type using a remote and an on-screen keyboard. For others, such as the Echo, you have to switch back and forth between wifi networks to get everything set up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overcoming writing rustiness</title><link>/2018/12/03/overcoming-writing-rustiness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/03/overcoming-writing-rustiness/</guid><description>&lt;p>Now that I’ve forced myself to write every day in order to catch up on my blogging goal it’s been much easier.

One can get state of the art computers for about a thousand dollars and huge flat panel TVs for a few hundred dollars. I grew up in the 90s and it never felt that comparable gadgets were that cheap. It may be that I didn’t have a job and nearly everything was out of reach but I suspect electronic goods really are that much cheaper now. Even if a product launches at a higher price it doesn’t stay that way for long and drops much quicker than before. No price has staying power and there are always more efficient competitors catching up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Superhuman review</title><link>/2018/11/21/superhuman-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/21/superhuman-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m all about productivity so when I heard about &lt;a href="https://superhuman.com">Superhuman&lt;/a> I decided to give it a shot.

We live in such a digital heavy world that it’s difficult to imagine life without it. Yet it really is fairly recent. Personal computers only started becoming popular in the 1980s and the internet was only introduced in the 1990s. And it took a whole decade before the internet started resembling what we currently see. If we take the least restrictive definition of a computer we still get that computers have existed for less than a hundred years. That’s a blink of an eye in our history and it’s incredibly rewarding to read about the origin of the industry I’m a part of. Part of me wishes that I was around in the formative years so this is my way of feeling a little bit of that spark and discovery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Falling behind my 2018 blogging goal</title><link>/2018/11/18/falling-behind-my-2018-blogging-goal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/18/falling-behind-my-2018-blogging-goal/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since 2013 I’ve been writing 2 blog posts a week. This stemmed from a conscious effort to improve my writing, clarify my thought process, and grow my brand. It’s been quite a ride and while difficult I’ve been able to do keep it going for 5 consecutive years. This year I’m significantly behind but am still committed to catching up and hitting 104 posts. As I write this I’m only at 42 posts for 2018; I have 42 days to write 62 posts which means I need to write nearly 1.5 posts a day to make up for my prior sloth. I’m going to do as much as I can to hit that goal and will be extremely disappointed if I’m unable to do it. That may mean that some of the posts will be on the shorter side and half baked but there will be some that do offer something valuable and insightful. My blogging history tells me that it’s impossible (for me at least) to actually tell which posts will be popular and the best I can do is keep writing and share more of my thoughts. The one element I will not compromise on is editing - poor writing is a pet peeve and I’ll continue to edit my posts after they’re written.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Random quotes</title><link>/2018/11/17/random-quotes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/17/random-quotes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Besides blogging I’m a big reader and normally get through read a book a week. Most of my reading is done on Kindle and whenever I come across any interesting passage or quote I highlight them. Then every few weeks I go through my highlights, add them to a single &lt;a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/quotes/blob/master/quotes.txt">file&lt;/a>, and dump it into a GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/quotes">repo&lt;/a>. Earlier today I decided to do something fun and wrote a simple &lt;a href="https://bots.dangoldin.com/quoteme">endpoint&lt;/a> to fetch a random quote.

One of the tricks I’ve been using is to disable all images and avoid clicking any links that don’t go directly to the desired location. The reason for disabling images is that it prevents your opening of the email from being tracked since the image request (which contains some unique identifier) does not get made. The reason for not clicking on any of the links is similar - they’re rarely the final page you’re trying to get to but instead go through an intermediary that’s able to track your click. You can identify these by hovering over the link and seeing what the destination actually shows in the status bar. If it’s the page you want, great, otherwise I’ll go to the desired page directly or do an incognito search to get where I need to go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Incognito mode: Chrome vs Safari</title><link>/2018/08/21/incognito-mode-chrome-vs-safari/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/08/21/incognito-mode-chrome-vs-safari/</guid><description>&lt;p>To maintain some semblance of privacy I’ve been doing the majority of my searches in incognito mode.

As we’ve seen, terms of service are easily ignored and it may take years to notice that your data has been compromised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only way of securely sharing data with third parties is to not actually give it to them. That seems like a contradiction but there is a way out. Rather than shipping your data to them you instead have them provide their code to you. Their code can then run within your walls and you’re able to audit it to make sure it’s working as promised. This means giving third party developers a limited set of methods that can be used and preventing any but the most minimal data from leaving the system. That means as a developer you’re working in somewhat of a black box since even debugging gets difficult. In addition, as the platform you’re incurring the additional cost of hosting and executing these third party applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hunting for my old GeoCities site</title><link>/2018/03/03/hunting-for-my-old-geocities-site/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/03/03/hunting-for-my-old-geocities-site/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my first exposures to the web was geocities and I recall creating a site on GeoCities under the “Cape Canaveral” space.

&lt;p>I use Google Analytics on my blog and now that the year is almost over it’s time for the annual tradition of sharing the top posts of the year. The total number of pageviews in 2017 was a remarkable 36,410, around the same I received in 2015 and 2016 but below those of 2013 and 2014 when I was both more lucky in the popularity of my posts while and more aggressive in promoting my writing on Hacker News. While I feel my writing has improved over the years I feel my content has atrophied and is something I’d like to correct in 2018. What’s interesting is that out of all the views this year, 17% were from posts written in 2017, 74% were from posts written in previous years, and the remaining 9% were from non post pages. One argument is that as I build up a larger stable of content it will keep growing in percentage every year. At the same time I should start seeing an overall growth in views which hasn’t happened over the past few years. A worthy goal is to keep growing the total number of views of previous years’ posts while also making sure the current year’s are driving even more views and become the evergreen content for the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Medium experiment</title><link>/2017/12/22/my-medium-experiment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/12/22/my-medium-experiment/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last May I &lt;a href="/2016/05/15/experimenting-with-medium/">decided&lt;/a> to start cross posting to Medium to see what impact that would have on pageviews.

Applications that have existed for years and have widespread adoption have best practices that many devops engineers have mastered - think of Apache or nginx. On the other extreme you have single page apps that exist solely in the browser and don’t need any support from the devops team after they’re deployed. Yet there’s a whole range of applications in the middle that don’t fall neatly into either of the camps. They have a gamut of configuration options that are heavily dependent on the workload which makes it difficult for either side to manage individually. In my limited experience these tend to be common in the big data ecosystem - Spark, Druid, and Kafka are great examples. Go through any of the documentation and you discover how complex the configuration can get and how tough it is to get it right. Without having any prior experience it’s difficult to see how one can get it immediately right. It requires understanding the use case, the expected volume, and a fair amount of experimentation to get right. This is not something that can be determined by devops or core engineering alone and is ideally a group effort.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modern world of massive competiting corporations</title><link>/2017/11/11/modern-world-of-massive-competiting-corporations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/11/11/modern-world-of-massive-competiting-corporations/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m both fascinated and extremely unqualified to discuss China.

In the US we have Amazon which seemingly is getting involved in every industry but in China it feels as if every major technology company is doing the same. In this case JD is allying itself with Tencent - a competitor to Alibaba. Maybe it’s the natural order to have massive corporations competing with each other in every industry via partnerships with hundreds of competing startups.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Carrier specific iPhone ads</title><link>/2017/10/15/carrier-specific-iphone-ads/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/10/15/carrier-specific-iphone-ads/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had a bit of a lazy Sunday and spent some time watching some football games.

I’m not sure if Apple is even contributing anything to these but even if they are I suspect the branding outweighs the investment - especially since an ad viewer may decide to get the new iPhone regardless of their existing carrier.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scale challenges with AWS Athena</title><link>/2017/10/14/scale-challenges-with-aws-athena/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/10/14/scale-challenges-with-aws-athena/</guid><description>&lt;p>Almost a year ago, AWS &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-athena-interactive-sql-queries-for-data-in-amazon-s3/">launched Athena&lt;/a> which allowed you to query data directly off of S3. I loved the idea since it would allow us to simplify our workflow by reducing the need for Spark and Redshift while also cutting our costs. In theory queries that were being run via Spark or Redshift could just be run on top of data stored in S3 without having to load it into any system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Farewell, AIM</title><link>/2017/10/07/farewell-aim/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/10/07/farewell-aim/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/6/16435690/aim-shutting-down-after-20-years-aol-instant-messenger">big news&lt;/a> was that AIM will be shutting down in December after 20 years of service.

The implication is that the band members are currently in their 60s and 70s yet are still going on tour and performing nearly two hour long shows.

&lt;p>Amazon’s an incredibly competitive company with a ton of defensive moats but one I haven’t seen mentioned much is also the one I think is one of the most powerful: its sheer number of employees. And rather than having them isolated to a few key offices they’re spread out across a variety of cities, states, and countries. Amazon has over 340,000 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers_in_the_United_States">employees&lt;/a> which is almost 5 times the size of Google’s 72,000.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Focus on the story</title><link>/2017/08/28/focus-on-the-story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/08/28/focus-on-the-story/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week we hosted a meetup describing the evolution of our data pipeline over the past 5 years - starting with a simple script to aggregate log files to a fully fledged big data system relying on a slew of technologies ranging from Kafka to Spark to Redshift.

One small tidbit I discovered was that it would cost you $100 just to watch it in the comfort of your own home. And while I definitely don’t consider myself a sports fan that still feels ridiculous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone believes that the live nature of sports makes them completely different than other media and yet that doesn’t strike a chord with me. I’ve been to some live events and when you’re with a group the real time element and environment is critical. This also goes for the case where you’re a huge fan and need to know everything as soon as possible. But for the casual fan having a couple of hour delay doesn’t seem that critical. Sure you have to avoid hearing or reading about the outcome but without that knowledge the two situations seem equivalent - at least rationally, if not emotionally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Snapcode in the mail</title><link>/2017/08/12/a-snapcode-in-the-mail/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/08/12/a-snapcode-in-the-mail/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/snapcode-jet.jpg" alt="Snapcode for Jet.com" data-width="1512" data-height="2016" data-layout="responsive" />

Imagine a computer sending a message to another computer and then immediately deleting it. This message then gets sent from computer to computer without actually getting saved down anywhere. It doesn’t have a permanent home and just hops from machine to machine. If that computer shuts down before the message is passed on then it’s lost forever. Only by being on a machine when it receives a message do you get to see it - otherwise it keeps going along on its infinite journey. I like to think of this as information that only exists in wires and is constantly crossing the world at the speed of light.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The wild world of online trackers</title><link>/2017/07/23/the-wild-world-of-online-trackers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/07/23/the-wild-world-of-online-trackers/</guid><description>&lt;div class="right10">

The more cryptic and challenging the problem the more fun it is to sink my teeth into and the more rewarding it is when I finally get to the root cause. The real benefit of going through failures is that it is one of the best ways to get familiar with a tool or a technology. When things work we often only get a superficial understanding of the technology since we have no reason to go beyond the surface. When things fail, on the other hand, we’re forced to dig deep until we understand the cause of the failure and can make the necessary modifications to prevent the same issues in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Engineering, product, and design</title><link>/2017/05/27/engineering-product-and-design/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/05/27/engineering-product-and-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>The best products are built when engineering, product, and designers work together.

Some languages, such as Haskell, have wonderful and elegant design and are a joy to write but mostly remain hobby languages. Other languages, on the other hand, such as Java, may be rote and uninspired but have a massive amount of supported tools that allow them to keep growing. Unless we’re exploring or playing around the ultimate goal of every line of code we write is for it to be deployed to production and solid tools allow that to happen. Unfortunately, this also leads to a “rich get richer” scenario where a popular language continues to grow with an evolving and more compelling toolset rather than on any individual merits. And while the result is a better experience than it was before these new tools other languages may not have even gotten the chance to succeed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQL is the perfect interface</title><link>/2017/04/11/sql-is-the-perfect-interface/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/04/11/sql-is-the-perfect-interface/</guid><description>&lt;p>The more I code the more I’m exposed to SQL.

Nearly all code is taking some data, transforming it, and passing it along somewhere else. This implies that modifications change or add to this flow. It may be passing an additional variable to a function, changing the behavior of a function, or adding another step in our execution. It turns out that if the code is poorly written a seemingly minor change may require changing a series of functions since for some reason each function in the flow needs to be modified. Great code, on the other hand, is written in such a way where making a change to a single function or behavior doesn’t cause any changes upstream or downstream of the code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The effects of marketing on price</title><link>/2017/03/25/the-effects-of-marketing-on-price/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/03/25/the-effects-of-marketing-on-price/</guid><description>&lt;p>I like to think of myself as extremely relational and efficient and something that’s always bothered me is marketing.

In fact, George Akerlof wrote a paper in 1970, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons">The Market for Lemons&lt;/a>, which describes how markets with asymmetric information end up full of “lemons” and led to a Noble Prize.

This leads to a whole slew of inefficiencies and requires experts to help navigate the landscape who themselves benefit from the complexity and want to maintain it as much as they can.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Identifying product weaknesses using Google autocomplete</title><link>/2017/02/04/identifying-product-weaknesses-using-google-autocomplete/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/02/04/identifying-product-weaknesses-using-google-autocomplete/</guid><description>&lt;p>A simple trick I’ve started using when learning about new tools or technologies is to just type in “{name} vs” in Google search and see what pops up. This relies on the wisdom of the crowds and Google’s prediction to give me insight into other items in the same space. Oftentimes going to the corporate site gives me standard marketing copy but looking at comparisons provides the actual details: What do people use it for? What are the competitors? How does it compare against them? What are some success stories? What are some failure cases?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shame on United and Bank of America</title><link>/2017/01/26/shame-on-united-and-bank-of-america/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/01/26/shame-on-united-and-bank-of-america/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past month I had two experiences that seem too coincidental to be true and highlight how desperate some companies are to chase every penny. These are massive corporations that seem intent on sneaking in false fees and charges hoping that their customers don&amp;rsquo;t notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first involved United Airlines. The airline industry already suffers from poor reputation and it seems United is doubling down on it. I had a flight back from a vacation and thought I&amp;rsquo;d treat ourselves to an upgrade. United had an option to use miles and money which would charge you immediately, add you to the upgrade list, and refund both if you weren&amp;rsquo;t picked. We didn&amp;rsquo;t get the upgrade but we miraculously received a refund of the miles but only half of the money. It took a few phone calls but in the end I got the refund.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Find the arbitrage opportunities in hiring</title><link>/2017/01/14/find-the-arbitrage-opportunities-in-hiring/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/01/14/find-the-arbitrage-opportunities-in-hiring/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the football playoffs upon us I’ve been thinking of why some teams are more successful than others. They all have approximately the same budget to allocate across a 53 person roster yet some teams are consistently dominant while others predictably fail. What’s so special about the teams that succeed? There’s obviously the coaching but I believe the bulk of the credit should go to the players. Imagine if a single team had a budget that was an order of magnitude more than the next best team: that team would be stacked with the best players and would dominate in competitions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Information bandwidth of audio and display ads</title><link>/2017/01/11/information-bandwidth-of-audio-and-display-ads/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/01/11/information-bandwidth-of-audio-and-display-ads/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been reading a lot of articles lately on how the shift to audio interactions at home, namely Echo, have the potential to disintermediate Google. The gist is that Google makes the bulk of its revenue from search ads that will show up alongside the organic results. At that point the user can either click on an organic result powered by Google search or an ad powered by an auction. This approach works for the web where we can process the page at a glance but doesn’t translate neatly in an audio context. Imagine asking the Echo to give you the local weather but instead of that getting a list of weather related options first. That would be an utter flop but we tolerate it on the web where our eyes have multiple of orders more information bandwidth than our ears.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Top posts of 2016</title><link>/2017/01/04/top-posts-of-2016/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/01/04/top-posts-of-2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been writing two posts a week since the beginning of 2013 and at this point I have quite a few articles - some are one hit wonders, others are completely forgotten, while a select few are “evergreen” and are able to continually attract readers. With the start of 2017 I’ve seen a ton of bloggers doing a post highlighting their top posts from 2016 so I figured it would be fun to do the same. The data was all fetched using Google Analytics but there was a week long gap in early September when I deliberately broke the tracking while upgrading the blog to AMP. While I was hoping to get some increased growth in 2016 the total traffic ended up being pretty close to that 2015. A goal for 2017 is to focus more on evergreen posts with the goal being to build a larger audience with posts that are less responsive to the news and more about providing real value. And now on to the data:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Year in review: 2016</title><link>/2017/01/02/year-in-review-2016/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/01/02/year-in-review-2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>A hallmark of blogging is to do a year in review post with every blogger having their own distinct style. Some write about their tops posts, others about the lessons learned, some focus on the books read or places seen. I’ve been keeping meticulous daily stats around the hours slept, my physical and mental states over the course of a day, as well as the food, coffee, tea, soda, and alcohol consumed and the review is an opportunity for me to summarize and visualize this data. The goal is to identify healthy and unhealthy trends over time and use that information to make changes in my life. At the moment the stats are mostly high level summaries but what I want to do is use this data in order to identify hidden relationships in order to improve my physical state and mental moods. This is a work in progress but I hope to do more of that this coming year as well as improve the way I’m gathering this data. The analysis &lt;a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/annual-stats-analysis">code is up on GitHub&lt;/a> with a guide and a sample file that can be analyzed.

Looking at this list the primary themes were rediscovering my love for science fiction, digging deeper into society and culture, getting back into history - both focused on technology but also the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

This encourages us to improve our tools and languages to accommodate new patterns and challenges. Many of these improvements have come due to better hardware since we&amp;rsquo;re better able to cope with slight inefficiencies at the expense of higher productivity. This, coupled with the constant advancement of compilers and interpreters, has led to a massive adoption of scripting languages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the trade-offs we accept when we use scripting languages. They&amp;rsquo;re easier to dive into and make it easy to build a prototype. This is especially easier with the growth of open source tools and frameworks. Unfortunately, these prototypes are difficult to scale as as they and the team working on them get larger in scope. The lack of strong and static types makes it more difficult to undertake large scale refactors and encourages type-related bugs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It's donation season</title><link>/2016/12/09/its-donation-season/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/12/09/its-donation-season/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s that time of the year when many organizations are ramping up their donation efforts and I wanted to share the organizations I donate money to.

Every once in awhile when I’m a bit nostalgic I’ll go through these old projects and mend some of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What’s surprising is discovering old projects and scripts that work as is without me having to do anything to update the underlying code. I’m used to so working with so many open source libraries and cryptic documentation that it’s rare to find a public library that works exactly as you expect. Of course my projects are much simpler than the typical open source library but I find it remarkable that I can get code up and running within a few minutes of a checkout.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Restricted highlighting on the Amazon Kindle</title><link>/2016/11/06/restricted-highlighting-on-the-amazon-kindle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/11/06/restricted-highlighting-on-the-amazon-kindle/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love to read so it took me a surprisingly long time to get a Kindle.

&lt;p>While exploring the city earlier today I ended up wandering too close to the Google building and somehow got connected to their guest wifi network, GoogleGuest, and noticed that iOS 10 gave me an “Security Recommendation” notification. My first reaction was that this was an Apple jab at Google but It turns out that iOS 10 introduced a &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/07/22/ios-10-unsecured-networks/">new feature&lt;/a> to let people know that they were connecting to an open network. The intent seems to be to warn users that they may not be on a secure connection but it’s a bit hidden away and didn’t actually prevent me from connecting: it was more of an FYI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Comparing my top sites: 2012 vs now</title><link>/2016/09/10/comparing-my-top-sites-2012-vs-now/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/09/10/comparing-my-top-sites-2012-vs-now/</guid><description>&lt;p>While going through and making sure each of my old posts was AMP compatible I came across a &lt;a href="/2012/06/07/achieving-browser-autocomplete/">post from 2012&lt;/a> where I tried to list the first autocomplete suggestion for each letter. This naturally made me think of what the results would be if I did the same exercise now. Comparing the information 4 years apart is an interesting way to see how my habits have changed but also provide a glimpse into the evolution of companies, products, and technology. The biggest surprise is how much of the list is work related - it’s somewhat expected given how much time we spend working and how many more cloud services there are but it’s still shocking that almost half the list is work related. The other major realization is that much of my consumption has shifted to mobile - many of the sites that are no longer on the list I actively use on my phone; I may actually use Instapaper, Google Maps, and Twitter more frequently now but it’s mostly on mobile via an app. Given how interesting this exercise was I plan on doing this annually and encourage others to do the same - it’s an extremely simple way to see how technology and our relationship to it changes over time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AMP migration scripts</title><link>/2016/09/08/amp-migration-scripts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/09/08/amp-migration-scripts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over Labor Day weekend I migrated my blog to use &lt;a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">AMP&lt;/a> but the first version was definitely a work in progress. One big item I needed to take care of was converting all my images to be AMP compatible by replacing &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tag with &amp;lt;amp-img&amp;gt; along with the image width and height. I ended up writing a quick Python script to go through each of my posts, find each &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tag, get the image’s dimensions, and then replace the original tag wit the AMP version. Unfortunately, I ran the script without too much testing and forgot to add closing tags which caused some of the content to go missing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AMPifying my blog</title><link>/2016/09/05/ampifying-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/09/05/ampifying-my-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since AMP was announced I’ve been meaning to migrate my blog but hesitated due to the fear that it would take an inordinate amount of time and would be laden with edge cases. But over the Labor Day weekend I decided to give it a shot and see how far i could get. A quick GitHub search showed two promising repos - &lt;a href="https://github.com/juusaw/amp-jekyll">amp-jekyll&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ageitgey/amplify">amplify&lt;/a> - and I gave them both a shot. They approach AMP integration in two different ways - amp-jekyll creates an AMP version of every post and has it live in a separate folder structure while amplify is a comprehensive theme. This made the amp-jekyll integration much easier since it’s designed to work parallel to the existing blog but I wanted to do a full rewrite.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Violating the norms of a social network</title><link>/2016/09/01/violating-the-norms-of-a-social-network/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/09/01/violating-the-norms-of-a-social-network/</guid><description>&lt;p>Social networks carry extreme network effects and have massive winner-take-all dynamics. This makes it impossible for two social networks that have the same pitch to co-exist and leads to pretty strong differentiation. Facebook owns relationships. Twitter owns interests. Instagram owns lifestyle. Snapchat is starting to own experience. This is why I find it fascinating when the content from one social network or medium bleeds into another. Twitter doesn’t allow for tweets longer than 140 characters so people overcome that by sharing screengrabs of long form text. I’ve seen the same on Imgur - it’s primarily used for images but often you’ll see someone posting an image of a long story. We have our own unique relationships across each of these networks so it’s not surprising that we’ll sometimes want to communicate something that’s best expressed with a specific medium yet it’s still fascinating seeing it in action. I get the feeling that they’re publicly exploiting a loophole and adding a tiny bit of chaos to the universe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Food identification with Google's Cloud Vision</title><link>/2016/08/29/food-identification-with-googles-cloud-vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/08/29/food-identification-with-googles-cloud-vision/</guid><description>&lt;p>Something that I haven’t quite figured out is how to avoid wasting food. I like to think I keep good track of everything in my fridge but too often I end up finding something in the corner that spoiled and needs to be thrown out. Earlier today I was talking to someone at the office about this problem and how nice it would be if you could just have something that knows everything that’s in the fridge and can track how long it’s been there and an estimate of how long it will last. I’m sure refrigerators in 10 years will have this built in but I wanted to see what I could cobble together in an evening.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Giving wallabag a shot</title><link>/2016/08/28/giving-wallabag-a-shot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/08/28/giving-wallabag-a-shot/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been a happy Instapaper user for years but the news that it was being acquired by Pinterest got me thinking about some alternatives.

Then I wouldn’t have had to go through a variety of hoops and iterations to get the data I needed and would also not have to worry about changes to their page design breaking the script. This got me thinking about an idea to write my scraper in such a way that it’s exposed as an API. In that case I can architect the code so that the retrieval and manipulation of the ride data is completely separate from the scraping code. Then if and when Turo does decide to release an official API all I’d need to do is swap my unofficial implementation out for the official one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Consumer tech leads to cyborgs</title><link>/2016/08/08/consumer-tech-leads-to-cyborgs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/08/08/consumer-tech-leads-to-cyborgs/</guid><description>&lt;p>The iPhone is the top selling consumer product of all time and a variety of podcasts and articles makes it seem that this is the peak of consumer technology and we’ll never see anything as popular.

Every new technology achieved wider and wider adoption and eclipsed the previous generation - &lt;a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/4/25/ipad-growth">laptops eclipsed desktops and smartphones eclipsed laptops&lt;/a>. One thing that’s clear is that each generation of tech gets closer and closer to us. Initially we were exposed to computers when we went into the office. Soon we started buying desktops for our homes. After that we decided we wanted laptops that we could carry around with us. Smartphones gave us the ability to carry computers around in our pockets with a full day’s worth of charge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One of my favorite programs</title><link>/2016/08/06/one-of-my-favorite-programs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/08/06/one-of-my-favorite-programs/</guid><description>&lt;p>While working on a &lt;a href="/2016/07/17/coding-puzzle-word-transformation-through-valid-words/">small programming puzzle&lt;/a> I remembered Peter Norvig’s &lt;a href="http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html">spell checker&lt;/a> and how blown away I was after seeing it for the first.

I was also a few blog posts behind so decided to see how much I could actually do via phone. Surprisingly, I got a fair amount done. The posts still required a fair amount of editing when I was back on my computer but for getting the bulk of the content and structure down on my phone was nearly as good as via a real keyboard. What it lacked in speed it made up for by not having real multitasking which made it more difficult to get distracted. It wouldn’t work for posts that require search or significant research but for quick blurbs or jotting down thoughts it works remarkably well and I suspect it will only improve with time. Years ago I viewed phones and tablets as being purely designed for consumption rather than creation so this has been a pleasant surprise and I’m coming around to the idea that one can be productive without an actual computer. Next is to try attempting to write a blog post via voice dictation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Following up on a website optimization offer</title><link>/2016/06/11/following-up-on-a-website-optimization-offer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/06/11/following-up-on-a-website-optimization-offer/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been getting a stream of offers to help “optimize” my site and decided to follow through with one and see where it went.

Uber is winning right now due to massive network effects. For most drivers and passengers Uber is the primary option and they only switch when Uber is either in surge if you’re a passenger or if you’re a driver when no passengers are available. Self driving cars eliminate half of the market. They won’t need to balance multiple apps on their phones and won’t need to go back and forth trying to find a passenger. It will all happen behind the scenes and do a much better job than any human would. They’d be as likely to work with Uber as any of their competitors. In fact, the entire protocol may evolve to be open with owners setting up their cars to start picking up and dropping off passengers when they’re not in use. The equivalent of how you can sell electricity back into the grid without having to do a ton of extra work. Imagine being able to own a car and just let it roam so it starts earning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Experimenting with Medium</title><link>/2016/05/15/experimenting-with-medium/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/05/15/experimenting-with-medium/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite my &lt;a href="http://dangoldin.com/2014/02/02/why-i-manage-my-own-blog/">aversion&lt;/a> to walled gardens and platforms I’ve seen a ton of people make the switch to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/">Medium&lt;/a>.

Just in the past week I wanted to search for a short story I wrote while in middle school that I digitized at some point over the past few years. My first attempt was to search for “paper” which got me too many results to parse through. But for my second attempt I tried “essay” and was able to find a photo of one of the hand-written pages. It was simple to look at the date I uploaded that one page to find the others. A couple of days ago I was out of town but needed my passport information to fill out an online government form.

Sure enough, investors interpreted this as good move by Amazon (up 1.51% at end of day) while hurting Netflix (down 2.79% at end of day and even more post earnings). These percentages translate into a $1.34B decrease to the Netflix valuation and a $4.49B increase in valuation for Amazon.

One pattern that stood out for me was how Amazon was able to continuously push into new business areas due to the infrastructure that they had in place based on previous decisions and commitments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They started with books but were able to grow into other smaller products once they figured out the logistics behind shipping smaller items. Once Amazon had that in place they kept tweaking their distribution system to expand the variety of products offered while improving the speed of delivery. This allowed them to keep amassing a list of products which they used to open up their platform to third party sellers. And as Amazon improved their infrastructure they were able to open that up to these third party sellers as well. In parallel, they built AWS to provide computer services to internal Amazon teams but were able to turn it into a brand new line of business that powers the majority of new startups. And now their are rumors of Amazon building out a shipping service to bypass FedEx and UPS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unbundling politics</title><link>/2016/03/27/unbundling-politics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/27/unbundling-politics/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday I made the case that the current political system consists of a &lt;a href="/2016/03/26/political-parties-are-product-bundles/">series of product bundles&lt;/a> and I’ve been thinking of ways unbundling would work. And what better way than to look at existing products and industries that have been unbundled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As numerous people have pointed out, the music industry is a clear example. Initially music was sold on CDs and there was no idea of buying solo songs.

AIs will continue to improve and we’ll start seeing more and more of this behavior across a wide range of problems and not just games. The most significant part for me was that this was achieved by Google and not by IBM. IBM had two recent notable achievements in AI - one was building Deep Blue in 1997 which beat Gary Kasparov in chess and the other was building Watson in 2001 which dominated at Jeopardy.

A typical modern tech startup starts by identifying a problem and using a common web framework to quickly come up with the first pass. But as this company grows new problems and situations arise that the initial solution no longer supports. They may end up having a series of asynchronous tasks and need to start using RabbitMQ with that use case. MySQL may no longer be enough and they start offloading their data to Redshift. That off the shelf web framework is no longer performant enough so they have to split it into multiple components and start embracing strong, statically typed languages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Aural information density</title><link>/2016/02/27/aural-information-density/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/02/27/aural-information-density/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whenever I watch some online lectures or listen to a podcast one of the first things I do is change the speed to either 1.5x or 2x the original.

But the fact that I can absorb and process information at twice the speed makes me wonder how much more productive I’d be if every conversation I had occured at twice the speed.

After going through the obvious examples (what’s the weather, tell me a joke, add x to my shopping list, play song y) and playing around with it I’m past the gimmick stage. The always on listening is really a different way to interact with our devices. Conceptually it’s no different than using Siri or Google Now but in practice it’s a world of difference. I don’t always have my phone with me and for some things it just feels more natural to start speaking and see an immediate effect. Whether that’s playing some specific songs or playlists, changing the volume, or adding items to a shopping list it feels more natural than having to go through a phone. One of my favorite use cases so far has been using the Echo to keep track of my shopping list. In the past I’d be in the kitchen and realize we needed something and would forget as soon as I switch tasks. With the Echo I can immediately call out what to add and have the list readily available next time I go to buy something.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Longer terms in government?</title><link>/2016/02/13/longer-terms-in-government/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/02/13/longer-terms-in-government/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many have written about society’s inability to enact laws quickly enough to deal with the current pace of technological innovation. Governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate the sharing economy with both AirBnB and Uber being reacted to rather than being effectively regulated. This leads to different treatment in different locations and causes confusion for consumers, the businesses, and regulators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A potential way to rectify this is to actually increase term limits for people in government. With politicians focusing on reelection every few years and constantly moving in and out of office it’s tough to develop a consistent regulatory approach. This worked well a hundred years ago when new industries would take a decade to develop and you could regulate them as they grew. Now it can take a year for entirely new businesses to be created before governments can react to what’s happening. By then the new consumer behavior has become entrenched and becomes difficult to change. Rather than worrying about reelection and undoing prior policies politicians should be focused on the future and how to adapt government for an increasingly changing society.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Retargeting gone wrong</title><link>/2016/02/10/retargeting-gone-wrong/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/02/10/retargeting-gone-wrong/</guid><description>&lt;p>Retargeting ads work by checking to see a product you’ve looked at and then showing you that product over and over again with the hope that at some point you buy it. There are entire companies dedicated to this with extremely sophisticated algorithms so I’m surprised when I see inefficient behavior. In my case it was an Amazon ad that kept following me around even after I already purchased the product, a precision cooker. Given that Amazon knows my purchase history and sees that I’ve already bought the cooker it makes no sense to keep showing it to me. It seems that their algorithm figured this out as well and started showing me the same product in different packages and at different price points. The fact that they have logic that’s smart enough to show me different variations of the same product but not take into account my purchase history shocks me. What makes this even worse is that I own some Amazon stock and realize that this inefficiency has an impact, albeit a tiny one, on my shares.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The famed 10x developer</title><link>/2016/01/24/the-famed-10x-developer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/01/24/the-famed-10x-developer/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you’re in the software engineering world you’ve probably heard of the 10x developer. They’re an order of magnitude more productive than everyone else and can make all sorts of problems go away. The 10x number is completely arbitrary but I’ve worked with numerous developers who were notably more productive than others. A big part of it is just being able to write more code - a combination of knowing the right tools for the job and moving quickly while avoiding mistakes. But a bigger part in the productivity comes from making the appropriate decisions that are able to stand the test of time. If your code needs rewriting every time a new feature comes out it’s going to be tough to be as productive as someone whose code can be easily expanded and maintained as the product evolves. Great developers make design decisions that are able to solve the immediate problem but also leave a clear path for the improvements that will inevitably come. If you know what’s coming in a couple of months or in a year it’s simple to account for it in the current design but the real skill comes in being able to think of the unanticipated cases and be able to support them with minimal effort. Beyond that some choices end up unlocking opportunities that would have been difficult to fathom in the first place. Imagine coming up with an elegant implementation that solves an urgent problem and a couple of months later you realize that with minimal tweaking that implementation can turn into something that is transformative to the product. It’s impossible to think through every decision since you’ll end up stuck in a world of “analysis paralysis” but great engineers either have a gut feel or enough experience to make these high leverage decisions more frequently than others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lessons from 2015</title><link>/2016/01/01/lessons-from-2015/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/01/01/lessons-from-2015/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part of my 2015 goals was to have a weekly retrospective where I’d be distraction free and force myself to just sit and think.

The five of us - parents, younger brother, and younger sister - are all on the same plan and T-Mobile breaks down the usage into phone minutes used, messages sent, and total amount of data used. I played a game with my friends to see whether they’d be able to decipher who’s who but it turned out to be surprisingly difficult and unintuitive. Turns out that my teenage sister uses least talking minutes and data but consumers average number of texts. At the same time, my mom runs a business and has close to 2000 minutes of talk time with the most number of texts sent while only using a moderate amount of data. My brother and I have a similar usage pattern - low minutes and messages but the highest data usage out of the entire family. The biggest surprise is my sister’s data usage that reinforces how much time teenagers are spending via apps and on separate social networks. That stereotype I grew up with of teenagers being constantly on their phones is still true - texting and talking have just bee replaced by siloed apps.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automatically generating APIs</title><link>/2015/12/19/automatically-generating-apis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/12/19/automatically-generating-apis/</guid><description>&lt;p>A large part of modern software engineering is working with external APIs and services. Whether you want to automate a deployment on AWS, collect payments via Stripe, or track various behaviors using MixPanel, the process is the same - go through their documentation to figure out the available endpoints, the request requirements, and what the response will be. The next step is writing a simple API wrapper around the relevant endpoints that can then be accessed by the rest of the application. Given all the investment in AI research I’d love to see an application that’s able to generate API wrappers in any language for an API based solely on the documentation. Amazon has taken the first steps by &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-aws-sdk-for-python-3-boto3/">developing a data model&lt;/a> to represent their API which is then used to generate the actual libraries in a variety of languages.

Even then I’d bet it takes less than an hour to get things to an 80% state at which point I’ll only discover what’s missing by just going through my day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Apps on LTE, mobile web on wifi</title><link>/2015/11/09/apps-on-lte-mobile-web-on-wifi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/11/09/apps-on-lte-mobile-web-on-wifi/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately, I’ve noticed an interesting trend with my smartphone usage.

These days the corporate equivalent would be that a company marches on its data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every company claims to be data driven and there’s a slew of data collected about us each day. The most successful companies are able to leverage this data and use it to derive insights that drive direction. Unsuccessful companies may collect the same data but don&amp;rsquo;t leverage in an impactful way. It’s easy to collect information but it’s a huge challenge to turn into action. There are many options just for storing the data: one approach may make it easy to store tons of data while making it hard to run large scale analyses while another allows for a distributed computation approach that&amp;rsquo;s too slow. Beyond data storage there’s the actual analysis piece: what’s the appropriate model to use that can represent the relationships between the variables while being true to life? All these are questions that will become increasingly critical and separate the winners from the losers. Data itself has potential for massive &lt;a href="http://dangoldin.com/2013/07/21/beware-the-data-monopoly/">monopoly feedback loops&lt;/a> - companies that succeed are able to collect more and more which improves their product which collects more data. Right now it may only seem as if larger companies should care but I suspect within the next 10 years we’ll see more and more small and local businesses adopt a truly data-driven approach, whether through internal tools or through external services&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zoning Airbnb</title><link>/2015/11/05/zoning-airbnb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/11/05/zoning-airbnb/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been meaning to share some thoughts on regulating Airbnb for a couple of months now but kept putting it off. The &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/10/21/Airbnb-ads/" target="_blank">recent news&lt;/a> was motivating enough for me to finish it off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m a huge fan of Airbnb and it’s my first step whenever I’m traveling. Nearly all my experiences have been great and I’m contemplating getting rid of my Starwood card since it’s just not as useful anymore given that I gravitate towards Airbnb first.

Other than the code quality and approach improving over time what stood out was the way I approached deployment. My earliest projects didn’t have a set of requirements and the configuration was all over the place. The more recent projects have a clear set of requirements as well as the command lines needed to get them running. In fact, I’m able to build and run my recent projects within a few minutes by running “pip install -r requirements.txt”, updating the configuration file, creating the database, and running the database migration script. This is a massive improvement when compared to my initial projects where there was no documentation and my setup involved a ton of adhoc, undocumented work directly on the production server that’s now lost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some nostalgia</title><link>/2015/10/29/some-nostalgia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/10/29/some-nostalgia/</guid><description>&lt;p>This past weekend I was going through some old projects and got a bit nostalgic.

The typical example is people abandoning legacy television for YouTube. Thus, the rationale goes, the time people would have spent watching television has been replaced by them watching YouTube.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I understand the concern. People are watching less and less standard television with only time sensitive and restricted content (ie sports) being viewed on television but there’s a world of nuance. People may be watching less and less broadcast television but the content that’s being consumed is growing. Cordcutters pride themselves on not paying for cable television yet they’re still subscribing to Netflix and Hulu. The same shows are being watched - just not on the usual devices. In addition, there’s the rise of multi-screen consumption - we’ll be on our phones or laptops while watching TV. Whether it’s a distraction from a commercial, a way to follow an event on Twitter, or just browsing Wikipedia to get a bit more information, we’re parallelizing our media consumption and increasing the size of the media pie rather than solely switching between platforms.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The iPad Pro and Apple's walled garden</title><link>/2015/09/26/the-ipad-pro-and-apples-walled-garden/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/09/26/the-ipad-pro-and-apples-walled-garden/</guid><description>&lt;p>Supposedly the performance of the recently announced iPad Pro will rival that of the Macbook and encourage tons of people to buy it with productivity in mind rather than just consumption. And at a starting price of $799 it’s significantly cheaper than the Apple laptop options. Apple is known for achieving large product margins but I wonder if the iPad Pro is sold at a lower margin to get people to switch to iOS and get even more tied to Apple’s ecosystem. I currently use a Macbook Pro for my work but can switch to any Unix based environment without any hit to my productivity. I’m not sure if this is me being too cynical but I can definitely see Apple taking a long term view here and taking a much lower profit margin on the iPad Pro in order to get people to actually make the switch to the walled garden of iOS. Among the developer community Safari is already seen as the &lt;a href="http://nolanlawson.com/2015/06/30/safari-is-the-new-ie/" target="_blank">reincarnation of IE&lt;/a> given Apple’s lackluster support. These may just be coincidences but for a company as detail oriented as Apple this feels like a strategic decision to shift away from the open web and into the walled app garden.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keep on learning</title><link>/2015/09/20/keep-on-learning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/09/20/keep-on-learning/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a strong believer that one needs to keep learning and to not get content with the knowledge they have.

" target="_blank">adopted&lt;/a> a “pay what you want” pricing model. Customers have an incentive to underpay the final check so I was curious to see how Blu handled it throughout dinner. I noticed three tactics they used to get people to pay fairly and am sure they utilized a bunch more that I didn’t even notice:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Anchoring: Before sitting down to eat the waitress explained that it was pay what you want and most of the dishes are estimated to be priced between $10 and $12. This sets the expectation early so if you do decide to pay less you’re making an explicit decision to underpay.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reminder: At the end of the meal we were told how many dishes we ordered. This was also helpful but I can’t help but think that this is a way to give you an estimate of how much you should pay - especially when paired with the fact that the expectation is $10 per dish - a very easy number to multiply.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shame: I found this the most interesting one. Instead of giving you a blank receipt and allowing you to write what you want to pay you have to tell the waitress what you want them to charge. This forces you to explicitly vocalize your payment to another person rather than quickly writing something and slinking away. And no one wants to be judged as cheap face to face so we’re encouraged to pay well.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I’m a huge fan of behavioral psychology experiments that shed some light on the way our minds work and it was a great experience to partake in one. I only wish I could have spotted more behavioral cues that I’m sure they employed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development cycles across programming languages</title><link>/2015/08/20/development-cycles-across-programming-languages/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/08/20/development-cycles-across-programming-languages/</guid><description>&lt;p>The most common way of making sure code works is by going through the “develop-run-test” loop. We write some code that we expect to have a certain behavior, we run the code and trigger that behavior, and then we confirm that the results are what we expected. And we keep iterating, hopefully making more progress with each new iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I’ve noticed is that this pattern varies drastically for me depending on the language I’m working with. I’ll cycle through iterations much quicker in Python than I will with Java. Part of it is that my Java projects are larger and take a longer amount of time to start but I suspect the bigger benefit is that Java’s strong and static type system makes it easier to take larger coding steps than I’d be able to with Python. For example, if I need to write a method to extract data from a JSON object I’ll approach it very different if I’m doing it in Python than I would if I were doing it in Java. With Python I’d jump into the REPL and walk through a few examples and make sure I handle the the various edge cases whereas with Java I’d place a lot more faith in the IDE and it’s litany of warnings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A phoneless day</title><link>/2015/08/16/a-phoneless-day/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/08/16/a-phoneless-day/</guid><description>&lt;p>As they say you don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate something until it&amp;rsquo;s gone and I got to experience first hand when I cracked the screen on my phone and dropped it off for a quick repair.

This makes it possible to create infinite streams since all you need is a function that&amp;rsquo;s able to compute the next value. In such a way we can create a stream of all numbers, just the positive even numbers, or just the prime numbers.

Rather than relying on outdated documentation or discovering undocumented features the database is the actual source of truth and defines both the limits and the capabilities of the application. You can examine the relationships between the various objects as well as the litany of features and options that are supported. It’s definitely more difficult to get up to speed on a database rather than documentation or a demo of the UI but the knowledge gained is significantly deeper. Especially when you’re going to be working on features that depend on the database it’s incredibly useful to know how the database is laid out and set up. On its own a walk through of the UI provides a high level overview of how it works but coupling that with the database allows you to internalize the connections and actually understand how the user interactions feed the data and vice versa.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tunnel vision</title><link>/2015/07/20/tunnel-vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/07/20/tunnel-vision/</guid><description>&lt;p>A common behavior when solving a coding problem is focusing too much on the solution and not enough on the general context.

Experienced developers will not only solve the task at hand but will also understand the limitations of their solution and are able to identify the areas that will be adversely affected by their solution.

&lt;p>I tried doing the same with Google Sheets and it works for smaller tables but as soon as you get tables with thousands of rows it’s noticeably slower than Excel. It’s amazing for what it can do but it feels as if the browser just can’t handle the rendering nor the calculation that a large spreadsheet entails. Some of the time closing and reopening the table fixes the problem but this is too reminiscent of Windows in the 90s and ends up in a glacial pace after a few minutes of work. I continue to use Google Sheets for small, collaborative files but for anything larger or anything that will need heavy computation I’ll switch to Excel. I’ve also been using R for more repetitive analyses but for the quick and dirty analysis that comes from the result of a SQL query Excel is still king.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Bloom filter in my head</title><link>/2015/07/16/a-bloom-filter-in-my-head/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/07/16/a-bloom-filter-in-my-head/</guid><description>&lt;p>As many at TripleLift will tell you I have a fondness for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter" target="_blank">Bloom filters&lt;/a> but only recently did I realize that our brains work in a similar way.

The entire book is worth a read if you’re interested in startups and the rise of Silicon Valley but one anecdote that immediately stood out was about the reason Apple didn’t use Intel chips &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple's_transition_to_Intel_processors" target="_blank">until 2005&lt;/a>. Before then Macs relied on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Macintosh_models_grouped_by_CPU_type" target="_blank">MOS Technology, Motorola and PowerPC&lt;/a> chips. The Intel Trinity makes the case that the reason Apple waited so long to adopt Intel chips was due to the fact that Steve Wozniak didn’t have enough money to build the Apple I prototype using Intel and had to resort to the cheaper option - a MOS 6502/Motorola 6800. And the reason Steve Wozniak didn’t have enough money was because Steve Jobs didn’t split the Atari payment fairly between them and took the lion’s share without even telling Steve Wozniak about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Domain specific API definitions</title><link>/2015/06/23/domain-specific-api-definitions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/06/23/domain-specific-api-definitions/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday, Amazon &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-aws-sdk-for-python-3-boto3/" target="_blank">announced&lt;/a> a major update to their Python client, boto3.

The idea is to use a drill/driver but instead of using a bit in the head you tighten it around the stripped screw. Then when it’s tight around the screw you drive it in until it’s where you want it to be. The other option is to use this approach to get the screw out and replace it with a brand new one to make sure it’s able to removable in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Chrome knows what's best for me</title><link>/2015/05/25/google-chrome-knows-whats-best-for-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/05/25/google-chrome-knows-whats-best-for-me/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier today I wanted to check up on my electricity bill but ran into an issue trying to login to my PSEG account.

I’ll go to Google Maps for directions, Foursquare for ideas of where to go, and Amazon whenever I need to buy something. They’re great most of the time but what’s interesting is what happens in the failure case. At that point my primary tool is no longer sufficient and I need to move on to secondary options. In these cases I tend to not have a well defined set of fallback options - for most of them I’ll fall back to the general case of using Google and then exploring from the search results. The only clear exception is Foursquare in which case I’ll go to Yelp before moving on to a general Google search. What’s surprising is that the fall back option usually leads to a successful outcome. Maybe I should switch my approach to start with the general search first and only move on to the specific tools when it fails. I wonder if we’re converging to a world run by fewer, smarter, and more powerful apps. &lt;a href="http://dangoldin.com/2013/07/21/beware-the-data-monopoly/" target="_blank">Data begets data&lt;/a> and as we supply more of it to the leaders we entrench their position, making it significantly harder for new companies to launch. We need regulation that enforces data mobility and allows people to export all the data that they’ve contributed and share it with whoever they’d like.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Experts, time, and quality</title><link>/2015/05/18/experts-time-and-quality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/05/18/experts-time-and-quality/</guid><description>&lt;p>We live in a world where it’s impractical to be a generalist so we specialize in a subset of skills and go to others for everything else. This works well but there’s still imperfect information - it’s tough to gauge someone’s skill level when you’re not an expert. In fact, when we lack awareness we end up using time spent as a proxy for skill when comparing across service providers. Imagine going to two barbers that charge the same amount for a haircut but one takes 10 minutes and the other takes 30 minutes. Even if we can’t tell the difference between the two haircuts we’d value the 30 minute one more due to the time difference. This seems backwards. The barber that was able to achieve the same result in 10 minutes is the more skilled one but instead we feel swindled when we back the price into an hourly rate. We should be willing to pay more for the 10 minute haircut since it gives us more time for our own pursuits. Yet when we lack knowledge we opt for the shortcut of equating time and skill. I’m trying to break this tendency by thinking about the end result rather than the effort and time involved. It’s interesting to compare this to software development. I know that just because someone spent more time on a project doesn’t mean it&amp;rsquo;s better than someone who knocked it out yet I still view other skilled professions from a “time equals quality” perspective. It makes you wonder whether professionals in other industries have a similar mindset where they realize time spent isn’t an indicator of quality in their own profession yet view it as a sign of quality in others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taking spontaneous notes</title><link>/2015/05/17/taking-spontaneous-notes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/05/17/taking-spontaneous-notes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many of my thoughts come serendipitously - whether it’s an errand I need to run, an idea for a blog post, or a feature I should build into one of my projects.

One of the tools I discovered was &lt;a href="https://mosh.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Mosh&lt;/a>. Mosh allows you to open a remote session just like you would do with SSH but unlike SSH it’s robust enough to handle networking disruptions. In fact, I can start a Mosh session on Friday afternoon before leaving the office for the weekend, let my computer go to sleep, and then have it automatically resume as soon as I get back to the office on Monday and wake my computer up. I’m still amazed at how well it works and only wish I discovered it sooner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Driving before GPS</title><link>/2015/05/09/driving-before-gps/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/05/09/driving-before-gps/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been thinking about driving before GPS. I remember my family having an atlas in the backseat that we’d reference for long trips and actually map out our journey - which roads to take, which exits to get off of exits, and the distances involved. My clearest memory was constantly trying to figure out whether we missed an exit or not. The usual solution was to just pay attention for the next couple of minutes and try to use the signs along with the road atlas to figure out where you were on the map. Now, you just type in the destination on your smartphone as soon as you get the car and just start driving. Even if you make a mistake the directions automatically update to correct your course. The amount of time saved by GPS for every trip that no longer needs to be preplanned or adjusted enroute must be incredible. I suspect it’s also changed the type of trips we’re making - rather than going to the same old nearby spots that we know we can get to, we’re confident enough to go beyond that and discover something new, knowing that our phones will bail us out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Computer show fliers from the mid 1990s</title><link>/2015/05/06/computer-show-fliers-from-the-mid-1990s/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/05/06/computer-show-fliers-from-the-mid-1990s/</guid><description>&lt;p>While doing some spring cleaning I discovered a bunch of fliers from various computer shows I attended in the mid 90s. Bsed on the Windows 95 and Windows NT promotions I suspect this must have been in 1995 or 1996. What’s striking is how much better our computers are. It’s one thing to be abstractly aware of Moore’s Law but shocking to actually see it. The top of the line model in 1995 was $2,500 and came with a 4 GB hard drive, 64 MB of RAM, a 200 MHz processor, and a 33.6 kbps modem. Adjusting for inflation, this is equivalent to $3,700 in 2015 dollars. With that budget you can a top of the line computer with an order of magnitude more of everything and still have enough leftover for a smartphone which is also an order of magnitude more powerful than a computer from the mid 1990s.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A unique solution to every problem</title><link>/2015/05/02/a-unique-solution-to-every-problem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/05/02/a-unique-solution-to-every-problem/</guid><description>&lt;p>A thought experiment I’ve had on my mind is this idea of a programming language that only has a single way of solving every programming problem.

No such language actually exists (yet) but it’s fun to think about extreme cases in order to understand where we stand now. With this programming language the only differentiation between developers would be time since the end result would be the same. Beyond that, if there was always a unique solution to every problem this language would be able to write the code itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A few days with Google Contributor</title><link>/2015/04/28/a-few-days-with-google-contributor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/04/28/a-few-days-with-google-contributor/</guid><description>&lt;p>Near the end of last year, Google announced the &lt;a href="https://contributor.google.com" target="_blank">Contributor&lt;/a> program - a way to pay a monthly fee which would then be distributed across the websites you visit. In return, you’d start seeing fewer ads. Earlier this week I got off the waitlist and decided to give it a shot. The signup process was amazingly simple - choose a monthly dollar amount and you’re good to go. The effect is noticeable - on many sites I’ll see a blank spot where an ad should have been. The best part is being able to see how much I’ve contributed to the various sites I visit. Over the past couple of days I’ve spent a little over 60 cents removing 51 ads. An unforeseen effect is that I’m more aware of the content I consume and the sites I visit - seeing that some of my money is going towards shady sites makes me more conscious of my browsing behavior.

Imagine how tough it would be to write code in an editor that didn’t have any of the features we use on a daily basis - syntax highlighting, smart spacing, shortcut keys, auto completion, etc. It takes time to get used to all the tools available but once we’re familiar with them we’re orders of magnitude more productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the past year my primary language has been Java although I’ve gotten to do a fair amount of JavaScript, Python, and PHP as well. As great as Sublime is, I’m much more productive in Eclipse. It has nothing to do with the editor and everything to do with the language. Eclipse is able to provide a lot more functionality due to Java’s static, strongly type nature. Some examples are being able to quickly rename variables and methods, move packages, and quickly identify dumb mistakes in method signatures and typos. I suspect similar tools exist for weakly typed or dynamic languages but I can’t imagine them working as well as they do in Eclipse. Strongly typed and static languages are able to get rid of an entire class of errors that are common with scripting languages - typos, forgetting to add an argument to a method call, messing up a type - that the time saved typing gets replaced with the time spent debugging. For many tasks this tradeoff makes sense but larger projects that involve multiple developers and require higher performance would benefit from moving to a strongly typed, static language.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Computer literacy for protection and productivity</title><link>/2015/03/08/computer-literacy-for-protection-and-productivity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/03/08/computer-literacy-for-protection-and-productivity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier today I came across another reason why basic computer literacy is a necessary skill.

&lt;p>Yesterday I got a reminder of how deep smartphones and tech companies have gotten into our lives. After spending a day volunteering at the &lt;a href="http://www.c4q.nyc/">C4Q&lt;/a> office, I got a text from my wife asking me where I was. When I opened the Hangouts app I saw an option to share my current location. This is the first time I’ve seen a contextual behavior in Hangouts. I’ve seen it before in other apps - a Gmail alert telling me I forgot to attach a file when the text has “please find attached” or Google Calendar defaulting to a weekly repetition if I put “weekly” in the meeting title - but this is the first time I’ve seen it happen in Hangouts. Basic contextual behavior is relatively simple to support and can just require a simple word search but it has incredible potential as more and more data gets collected. Our smartphones are with us wherever we go collecting data each step of the way. Right now the behavior is formulaic and standardized but soon enough our phones will act as personal assistants - keeping track of everything in our calendars while understanding everything we have going on. This has the potential to drastically simplify our lives but we may be making a Faustian bargain in the process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning Scala</title><link>/2015/02/13/learning-scala/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/02/13/learning-scala/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past week I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning Scala.

We lose a bit of the mystery when we document our lives and we no longer have long discussions trying to recreate events with friends. I don’t know whether this is better or worse but we’ll probably see more and more of this happening. Our phones are already collecting our location and video is becoming increasingly popular.

A small task typically turns into a series of small tasks in which I’m able to make a significant amount of progress. In fact, there have been numerous times where I’ve even been able to achieve “flow” - despite being hesitant in the first place. It doesn’t seem like much but 10 minutes here and there do add up.

On one hand, having many languages provides flexibility in choosing the right language for the job and allows engineers to learn and explore new tools. Better habits are encouraged since the interface between components requires a well structured and tested structure rather than relying on code similarity. On the other, it prevents code and component reuse and makes it difficult for teams to standardize around a style and codebase. Also, engineers can’t switch projects as easily as they’d be able to under a common language and prevents the depth of knowledge one gets from working on a shared codebase with others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A new Turing test</title><link>/2014/12/29/a-new-turing-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/12/29/a-new-turing-test/</guid><description>&lt;p>A friend sent me &lt;a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-06-09/fake-victory-for-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">an article&lt;/a> where the author discusses the recent news of an AI finally beating the Turing test and how he himself was clearly able to determine that the AI was not a human.

So many startups strive to get an investment and believe that once they raise a round everything will get easier. That’s when things get difficult. Instead of focusing on achieving product market fit you start worrying about market share, competition, company culture, recruiting, process, which require a completely different skillset than what you started with. And to add to that you’re now accountable to a growing list of employees, shareholders, and customers. When I was working on my first startup I really thought that being able to get funding was the measure of success. Now I realize how naive that view was and how much more there actually is. Fab raised over $330M and wasn’t able to grow into a successful business despite undertaking massive pivots. There are probably thousands of founders claiming that they’d be able to succeed with that kind of money without realizing how difficult it actually is.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Backendless applications</title><link>/2014/11/18/backendless-applications/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/11/18/backendless-applications/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been a fan of GitHub pages ever since I started using them to host my blog a couple of years ago and a thought that’s been constantly popping up is why there haven’t been any products or services that help small businesses host their sites on GitHub. GitHub’s &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/" target="_blank">terms of service&lt;/a> forbid a third party from hosting pages on behalf of customers but it doesn’t seem as if there’s anything stopping someone from building a tool or documenting the set of steps to help someone create a simple site and have it hosted on GitHub. That way the business only has to pay a domain registration fee while still getting fast and robust hosting with a fairly solid CMS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Productivity optimization</title><link>/2014/11/13/productivity-optimization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/11/13/productivity-optimization/</guid><description>&lt;p>A pretty trivial post but something I’ve been doing for a while now is keeping my dock as a vertical bar on the right of my screen. I started doing this years ago when I was working on Windows and it was too difficult to track every single program that was running. At that point I was in finance and would have a dozen Excel workbooks open and needed to be able to quickly switch between them. The only way I could do this with a bottom toolbar was by making it extremely thick which would take up too much space. Moving it to the side solved that problem and I stuck with it as I moved to Ubuntu and now OS X.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Libraries</title><link>/2014/10/28/libraries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/10/28/libraries/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/cornell-ad-white.jpg" alt="A.D.

They’re obviously spam and my readers are suave enough to never click on any of the links. There’s also little, possibly none, SEO value since they’re all loaded asynchronously and every link has a rel=”nofollow” property. And if the goal is to spark a discussiong and raise awareness they&amp;rsquo;re so poorly worded that no reader will take them seriously. The only thing I can think of is that these companies pay a third party service to grace tangentially related blogs with content on their behalf and these third party services go the cheapest possible route in both effort and quality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My first open source contribution</title><link>/2014/10/19/my-first-open-source-contribution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/10/19/my-first-open-source-contribution/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite being a huge proponent of open source I’ve never made a contribution to a &lt;a href="https://github.com/whymarrh/jeopardy-parser" target="_blank">third party project&lt;/a> until this weekend.

&lt;p>I understand that content sites make the bulk of their revenue through advertising but resorting to a link-bait approach seems like a terrible idea. It’s a shortsighted attempt that increases page views at the cost of insulting your audience and cheapening your effort that will not work as a sustainable strategy. Relying on headlines to generate traffic without any meaningful content is a great way to get to become a commodity. I hope that there are enough people out there that care about the content they’re producing and have a passionate audience that can be monetized based on quality of engagement rather than on quantity of page views. Otherwise we’ll all end up in a race to zero.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clearing my head</title><link>/2014/10/08/clearing-my-head/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/10/08/clearing-my-head/</guid><description>&lt;p>This weekend I felt discouraged after getting cold but dragged myself outside to go for a walk and clear my head. I ended up getting a cup of coffee and just sat on a bench for 30 minutes and letting random thoughts go in and out of my head.

It felt great (so great that I ended up going back to my apartment and doing a bunch of chores I’ve been putting of!), especially considering that I had to drag myself away from the couch to even go for the walk and would have much preferred to just sit on the couch and watch football.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>XKCD movie quotes by Android</title><link>/2014/10/04/xkcd-movie-quotes-by-android/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/10/04/xkcd-movie-quotes-by-android/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this week XKCD featured a &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1427/" target="_blank">comic&lt;/a> where oft-quoted movie quotes are autocompleted by iOS keyboard predictions.

An interesting piece comes at the 12:30 mark where he addresses the question “Right now software is powerful enough, what impact will improvements in hardware have on software?” His answer is great: “[We will] start chewing up power specifically to help that one on one interaction go smoothly and specifically not to help the calculation&amp;hellip; start applying that power to remove that barrier”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Web development bootcamps</title><link>/2014/09/17/web-development-bootcamps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/09/17/web-development-bootcamps/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently attended two web development workshop “meet and greet” sessions where recent graduates presented their projects and chatted with potential employers. I’m honestly surprised by how polished the projects were. Sure there were a few simple ones but most were solid; they were good ideas, well designed, and had functional backends. It’s amazing what it’s possible to do in 12 weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These programs focus on a single frontend framework, such as Backbone or Angular, and a backend framework, usually Ruby on Rails. With the number of plugins and public APIs available it’s easier to get an app up and running than ever before. Of course these programs won’t provide the same level of knowledge as a degree or years of experience will but for many projects that’s not important. Being able to get something functional and private is more important than perfect and private and these bootcamps provide enough skills to do that. More importantly, they make code accessible to an entirely new group of people and provide enough skills to allow them to continue learning on their own.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Importance of various tech services</title><link>/2014/09/07/importance-of-various-tech-services/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/09/07/importance-of-various-tech-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>A &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/05/monetization-automation-enforcement/" target="_blank">recent article&lt;/a> on our attachment to social media got me thinking about my most commonly used services and their relative importance. The goal is to answer the question of how I’d feel if various services suddenly disappeared.

Once we discovered it we needed a quick way to find these colleges and identify the contact details of their marketing or social media directors. Searching for this information was not the most efficient use of time for our small team so we went looking for other options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two options that stood out were &lt;a href="https://www.mturk.com" target="_blank">Mechanical Turk&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.odesk.com/" target="_blank">Odesk&lt;/a> but they were designed for quick and simple tasks. Using them for complex tasks would result in poor quality results. One advantage that Odesk had was that it allowed us to work with the same person for many tasks - something we couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to do using Mechanical Turk. This allowed us to come up with a set of potential candidates based on their project interest and skillset. We gave each of them the same set of problems to do and compared the results. Using this approach we discovered someone who was the right balance of cost and quality and we ended up working with her over the next few months to compile this list.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ephemeral security questions</title><link>/2014/07/27/ephemeral-security-questions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/07/27/ephemeral-security-questions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I thought I&amp;rsquo;ve seen every design anti-pattern out there but had the luck to run into a new one a couple of days ago.

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This quote refers to art but it can just as easily apply to code. As developers, we’re constantly exposed to new tools and technologies and are curious to try them out. Everything new looks shiny and we imagine it will solve all the problems we’re facing. Yet almost always new tools bring their own set of problems and take time to learn. Instead of constantly chasing something new we should try to master what we’re already using - the value of that will most likely outweigh playing with a new toy. It’s better to rely on a small set of tools that we understand well rather than have a superficial knowledge of dozens of tools and technologies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On having my Pinterest account hacked</title><link>/2014/06/15/on-having-my-pinterest-account-hacked/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/06/15/on-having-my-pinterest-account-hacked/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier today a I got a message on Twitter letting know that my Twitter account was hacked.

&lt;p>The fix was simple - block the Pinterest app from within Twitter, disconnect Twitter from within Pinterest, and reset my Pinterest password. Unfortunately, none of these can be done via the apps nor the mobile sites. Instead, both provide a minimal settings page with no clear way of accessing the complete settings.

It’s great, I edit files in &lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text&lt;/a> and came up with my own naming format to make search easier. If that fails, I just use grep and find and almost always find what I’m looking for. Since the files are plain text, every Linux command is a tool. It’s trivial to do bulk search/replace using sed or compose one liners to do various filters and counts. It’s easy to sort files by time or size and being able to do a regex search comes in handy when you only have a vague idea of what words you used when writing a note.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Approachable data science</title><link>/2014/06/02/approachable-data-science/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/06/02/approachable-data-science/</guid><description>&lt;p>Data science has earned the reputation of being complicated and inaccessible to those without an advanced degree but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way.

Within a few minutes I received the following response from &amp;ldquo;Kyle&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>Hi a guy bought this from me, but I can tell you where I got it from.
I got 3 of these from http://enetcweb.com/dibzees and I resold them for some extra money.
The trick is to watch for bidding to slow down and then put in a bid. That's what I do and I win most of the time.
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And this was from a listing that seemed legitimate! The vast majority of listings were clearly fraudulent that promised either amazing deals or was the same posting duplicated a dozen times with slightly different wording. Even beyond the fraud and scams there are probably tons of startups trying to take advantage of the network that Craigslist offers. Some are listing their products and services to validate their market and others are reaching out to owners of various listings trying to sell them on something.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some computer memories</title><link>/2014/04/13/some-computer-memories/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/04/13/some-computer-memories/</guid><description>&lt;p>Inspired by yesterday’s post I decided to compile a list the memories I’ve had growing up with computers - hopefully they spark others.

I grew up just as computers were becoming mainstream, the spread of the internet coincided with my teens, saw the rise of “Web 2.0” during college, and got my first smart phone a few years after college. It’s fascinating to think about how much has happened to the world since the rise of computers and the varying experiences everyone’s had.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hacker lore</title><link>/2014/03/28/hacker-lore/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/03/28/hacker-lore/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve always been interested in hacker lore and have recently started compiling a list of tech-related stories and anecdotes that I found amusing.

&lt;p>So far, I’ve only been able to recall and find two such anecdotes but will add more as I discover them. Depending on how many I gather I may put together a permament list page.

I start with one set of tags but as I go through my posts I realize that my initial set of tags no longer make sense and I need to restart. The challenge is finding the set of tags that are specific enough to categorize a single post yet general enough that they can be applied to other ones. I haven’t found the perfect set of tags yet but did manage to go through and tag each of &lt;a href="/tags">my posts&lt;/a>. Over time I hope to improve the tag taxonomy and update the existing posts. I’d love to hear suggestions on how to effectively organize my posts and examples of other blogs that are doing this well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Travel more</title><link>/2014/02/09/travel-more/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/02/09/travel-more/</guid><description>&lt;p>Now that I’ve started blogging I realize how important traveling is to creativity. After my trip to India I had a ton of different blog ideas. Some came from comparing the two cultures - for example cab rides and mobile phone business while others just came from realizations, such as the lack of truly global technology products. Many dismiss travel as a luxury but it’s a great way to bring a new perspective and let thoughts settle. In my case, it felt as if these connections formed subconsciously based on what I’ve been thinking about and doing actively for a year. It’s not surprising that our conscious experiences drive these subconscious connections but it’s interesting how stark this realization was. Prior to blogging, I never would have had an idea and immediately think of writing about it but it’s become a consistent thought. Travel encourages this serendipitous thought and companies should be encouraging it. Instead, many black ball employees who take a vacation and make employees feel guilty for taking some time off.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I manage my own blog</title><link>/2014/02/02/why-i-manage-my-own-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/02/02/why-i-manage-my-own-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>Given the recent news of Medium &lt;a href="http://recode.net/2014/01/28/medium-evan-williams-post-twitter-media-startup-raises-25-million-round/" target="_blank">raising $25M&lt;/a> and Svbtle &lt;a href="http://blog.svbtle.com/open-for-everyone" target="_blank">opening up&lt;/a> to the public I thought it would be an appropriate time to explain why I’m not using either of them.

It was also time for me to move on from my other projects so when I found out they were growing it was a pretty easy decision. Being a startup, it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what everyone’s responsibilities are since everyone becomes a generalist but I’ve been focused on the data side. This entails developing our various data pipelines, leveraging the data we have to improve performance and unlock new opportunities, and doing some light data science to help model and understand the native advertising space.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Security in the wake of MongoHQ</title><link>/2013/11/07/security-in-the-wake-of-mongohq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/11/07/security-in-the-wake-of-mongohq/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past few days my inbox has been filled with security alert emails caused by the &lt;a href="https://www.mongohq.com/home" target="_blank">MongoHQ&lt;/a> database hack. I’m impressed by the number of customers MongoHQ was able to sign up - they spanned the gamut from sites that I don’t even recall signing up for to startups that have been getting significant buzz.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a database as a service company is able to get hacked it doesn’t leave me optimistic about the way other companies are securing our data. As much as these “as a service” products make our lives easier they bring an increased risk to our business and more importantly our customers. Sure their security will be better than someone who’s setting up a MongoDB instance for the first time but that has to be balanced against the fact that a hosting site offers a much higher reward for a hacking attempt. Access to the infrastructure provides a lot more information than hacking an individual site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lessons from consulting</title><link>/2013/10/27/lessons-from-consulting/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/10/27/lessons-from-consulting/</guid><description>&lt;p>To supplement my income while working on a startup, I took on a few consulting projects and wanted to share some lessons learned. It seems that everyone’s consulting experience is different so consider mine experience as just another data point.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul class="bulleted">
 &lt;li>I was able to get more work from my existing network than anything else I tried. As soon as I told people I was looking to take on some consulting projects I was able to get interest and referrals. If I didn’t have that I’m not sure how I would have gotten my first few projects.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>It took longer than I expected to agree on a project’s scope and get the contract signed. My approach was to do a call or meeting to understand the goals of the project and then break it down into components with an estimated time and cost for each piece. I liked this approach since we were able to discuss the priorities of various pieces and talk about the risks associated with each.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>It took longer to get paid than I expected. I was confident that I’d get paid but it took a few emails and meetings to get the payments made. The part that helped was getting an initial deposit before starting the work.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>The biggest benefit was the flexibility to choose when and how to work on the projects. Unfortunately, this flexibility is better in the abstract. I didn’t find the flexibility that valuable since almost everyone I know is working at a full time job which causes me to also follow a pretty standard schedule.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>Most of the knowledge I gained was on the business/marketing side rather than on the tech side. I wasn’t doing challenging work and for the most part didn’t get a chance to work closely with others. The projects I did were also pretty independent so I had to resort to Google and Stack Overflow to help me deal with various questions that came up.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>The projects I had were not critical to the company and were mostly “nice to haves.” This had the effect of me not feeling very aligned with the company vision which made the projects less interesting than they should have been. I’m not sure if this was due to the way I positioned myself for consulting work or due to the companies not wanting to outsource their critical projects.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>A shared GitHub account worked amazingly well. The client was able to track the progress and provide feedback at various stages. This required me to commit well documented, working code but it definitely made communication easier. I also had a staging environment set up for my projects which let the clients see the code in action.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>I wrote a &lt;a href="http://dangoldin.com/2013/09/28/pricing-small-consulting-projects/">post&lt;/a> last month on pricing smaller consulting projects and wanted to highlight that again. I would come up a time estimate for a project that would be billed at my usual rate. Any work that spilled over would be billed at a discounted rate. This gave clients confidence that my estimate was reasonable and gave them a sense of the total project cost.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This was my first time doing serious consulting work and it’s a mixed bag. I enjoyed the flexibility but didn’t find it being a huge deal. I was also taking on projects that paid the bills but weren’t the most exciting. My biggest gripe was that I felt I wasn’t learning as much as I would have had I been working as part of a team. This gave the illusion that I was falling behind on my skills and not improving as much as others were.If I were to do it again, I’d want to specialize in a particular field and only do projects that fit in with my passions and interests. I’d also want to get it to the state where I’d be working alongside others rather than being entirely independent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>But I don't have time</title><link>/2013/10/14/but-i-dont-have-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/10/14/but-i-dont-have-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated by the expression &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have time&amp;rdquo;. As my friends and I have gotten older, I’ve been hearing it more and more frequently. I’ve even caught myself using when trying to come up with an excuse when coordinating evening or weekend plans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason I dislike the phrase is that it’s equivalent to saying &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not a priority&amp;rdquo; and yet we phrase it such that we convince ourselves it’s something outside our control rather than due to the choices we make. I could go out until 3 AM if I make that a priority over running 6 miles in the morning before heading to work just like I could go catch a movie instead of working on a side project. If we expressed our choices in terms of priorities rather than time we’d be more likely to deal with them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Decline of cynicism</title><link>/2013/10/12/decline-of-cynicism/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/10/12/decline-of-cynicism/</guid><description>&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten older and most likely more mature, I&amp;rsquo;ve become far less cynical. I used to be dismissive of people trying to improve things and believed that they were just wasting their time and nothing would change. Yet as a I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten older I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate this effort even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t lead to noticeable progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that someone is working for their beliefs should be applauded. The waste is dismissing others’ work while sitting in front of a computer or a TV. We all want to see progress and yet we exert effort belittling others that are actually committed to making things better. If we applied this effort into our own passions we’d be all be much better off.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Programming and math</title><link>/2013/09/17/programming-and-math/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/09/17/programming-and-math/</guid><description>&lt;p>The tech world is conflicted about how much math a developer needs. Engineers working on quantitative systems or data science clearly require advanced math and there are also countless engineering roles where math is unnecessary. My experience is that even if you don’t use math, having a mathematical mindset makes you significantly more productive. You’re able to quickly estimate the complexity of various tasks and hone your intuition. You’re also able to quickly recognize patterns when refactoring, especially when working in a functional language. A basic understanding of probability and statistics is a great way to analyze the performance of your code as well as help you model and understand your application behavior. I wanted to share a quick story of how a mathematical approach came in handy when working on Pressi.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Offering suggestions</title><link>/2013/09/16/offering-suggestions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/09/16/offering-suggestions/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since becoming active in the startup scene, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meeting a ton of founders and am annoyed by how much easier it is to offer suggestions than to apply them to myself. My most common suggestion, in true lean startup fashion, is to advocate a quicker or cheaper way to validate the market before building a product and yet it’s extremely difficult to take my own advice. I’ve been working on &lt;a href="http://better404.com" target="_blank">Better404&lt;/a> on and off for two months now and know I should get it in front of potential customers and yet I keep on making minor tweaks and updates to the product.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MoMath visit</title><link>/2013/09/11/momath-visit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/09/11/momath-visit/</guid><description>&lt;div class="right10">

&lt;p>I love the mission. Math should not be taught in a vacuum and having various activities that each showcase different mathematical properties is a great approach to get kids (and adults) engaged while learning some math. Some of the activities that stood out to me were bikes with differently sized square wheels that can only go around a certain diameter track; a &amp;ldquo;helix&amp;rdquo; shape that explains multiplication by lighting up a fiber between the numbers and highlighting the resulting value; and a fractal tree generator that would use your body to create the trunk and branches.

The goal was to learn as much as I could form others and apply these hard-fought lessons my own startup. Now that I’ve been working on a startup for almost two years I realize how much startups differ from one another and how black and white these guides tend to be. You can read two posts that will promote contradictory approaches. Should you focus on revenue or growth? Should you raise money or bootstrap? Should you go with a freemium model or paid only? Should you go solo or get a cofounder? Should you focus on consumers or the enterprise?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Teaching AP Computer Science</title><link>/2013/08/18/on-teaching-ap-computer-science/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/08/18/on-teaching-ap-computer-science/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year, I started volunteering at a program called &lt;a href="http://tealsk12.org/" target="_blank">TEALS&lt;/a>.

Over time, the goal is to have the in-service teachers in each class learn the material so that they will be able to teach it in the future. Currently, the program exists in 65 high schools across 12 states and offers both Intro to Computer Science and AP Computer Science but I’m looking forward to seeing it expand nationwide and into middle and elementary schools.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A brief history of manufacturing</title><link>/2013/08/02/a-brief-history-of-manufacturing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/08/02/a-brief-history-of-manufacturing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Working on &lt;a href="https://makersalley.com/" target="_blank">Makers Alley&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a fair amount thinking about the evolution of manufacturing and wanted to share an extremely condensed history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For most of human history, people either made what they needed on their own or traded with a local craftsman. Over time, this led to a specialization in skills and also the rise of the apprenticeship model. Since trade was mostly local, it was difficult to build a large business and most businesses were family run with parents passing down skills to their children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Security through monopoly</title><link>/2013/07/22/security-through-monopoly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/07/22/security-through-monopoly/</guid><description>&lt;p>A month ago I needed to duplicate a set of keys. In the past, I’d just go to the cheapest looking hardware store and they’d easily replicate my keys for around $2 each.

That locksmith told me that they wouldn’t be able to duplicate it without approval from my management company and also charged $18 for a duplicate. Amazingly enough, they were only able to duplicate one of the keys and I had to go to yet another locksmith (and get another approval) to get the last key duplicated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beware the data monopoly</title><link>/2013/07/21/beware-the-data-monopoly/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/07/21/beware-the-data-monopoly/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m convinced that the future of software lies in data.

We’re also tethered to our digital devices which are collecting tons of data that’s waiting to be analyzed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I worry that it’s going to get increasingly more difficult to build a software startup in the future as large companies develop data monopolies. Imagine trying to write language translation software without having access to Google’s data? Or trying to do audio transcription by relying on publicly available data? It’s going to be impossible to compete by relying on publicly available data source while large companies build out their internal data monopolies - especially by using their existing products to &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/data-management/google-wants-your-phonemes-539" target="_blank">subsidize the cost&lt;/a> of collecting this data. Data also begets more data. By giving us great experiences, we’re willing to provide more and more information that is then used to launch new products which have us surrendering more and more data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meetings: to take or not to take?</title><link>/2013/07/07/meetings-to-take-or-not-to-take/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/07/07/meetings-to-take-or-not-to-take/</guid><description>&lt;p>I struggle with this one. Some days I feel as if I should take every meeting since it’s impossible to know where it can lead. One meeting can completely change a business, generate some consulting work, or lead to new friendships. At the same time, taking every meeting would eat up a chunk of time and most meetings end up fading from memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m still figuring out my approach but do believe that having fewer, more meaningful relationships is more valuable than having many fleeting ones. Unfortunately, it’s not clear what will end up being meaningful before the meeting. Currently, I try to take every first meeting or at least have a phone call but have been scheduling them all on a single day, early in the morning, or late in the evening to avoid disruption. I’m also trying to make every meeting valuable by taking follow up notes in order to reach out later if I come across anything relevant or if I need to send an introduction. Probably the most important thing I’ve learned is that it’s easier to rejuvenate an older relationship than to create a brand new one so I’ve been making an effort to catch up with at least two former acquaintances each month.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Externalizing externalities in brick and mortar</title><link>/2013/07/01/externalizing-externalities-in-brick-and-mortar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/07/01/externalizing-externalities-in-brick-and-mortar/</guid><description>&lt;div class="right10">

For this post, I’m not interested in the content (which is great for anyone building a company) but I am interested in the concept of business frameworks and their application. When I was younger and came across a “business” framework I would dismiss it as obvious and move on. Now, I’m aware of how valuable a good framework can be. A good framework imposes structure that leads to a clearer though process with better results. At the same time, it needs to be simple to apply but be expressive enough to describe the complexity of a business. Being human, we also don’t want to think about our own fallibility and weaknesses which makes it difficult to critique our businesses. We also want to solve problems on our own rather than share our uncertainties with others. A framework serves as an impartial third party where you go through and fill in the blanks until you discover you aren’t in as good of a shape as you thought. Now you can work on growing your company instead of avoiding self-criticism.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pushing moral boundaries</title><link>/2013/06/20/pushing-moral-boundaries/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/06/20/pushing-moral-boundaries/</guid><description>&lt;p>Startups need to use everything in their arsenal to grow. A big part of it is playing in the grey area between moral and immoral. Do you create fake users and comments to portray an active community? Do you reply to posts on Craigslist trying to get visitors to your site? It’s also much easier to play in this area when you’re a startup - you’re most likely too small to be noticed and even if you are the press won’t spend much time on it. Google already gets a ton of flak every time someone complains about losing business due to a search engine update, imagine what would happen if a Google employee was caught spamming Craigslist.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Regulation and the share economy</title><link>/2013/06/16/regulation-and-the-share-economy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/06/16/regulation-and-the-share-economy/</guid><description>&lt;p>The past few years have seen the rise of the share economy with companies such as AirBnB, Sidecar, Lyft, and TaskRabbit seeing massive growth. Unfortunately, they’re getting significant opposition from government and the entrenched special interest groups. Most of the pushback is under the guise of consumer safety and that regulations exist to protect the consumer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regulation is necessary when there’s an information asymmetry between a service provider and a consumer. In such cases, regulations help bridge that information gap and make the consumer more comfortable making the transaction. But the internet has been chipping away at this gap by building communities where people can share reviews and experiences. Yelp, Angie’s List, and Google are the largest of these traditional review sites but reviews are starting to appear everywhere that money is changing hands. Ecommerce sites offer reviews and ratings of the products they’re selling. The share economy companies self-regulate by offering communities with well thought out rating systems. Without well functioning communities they wouldn’t survive.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Constantly entertained</title><link>/2013/06/12/constantly-entertained/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/06/12/constantly-entertained/</guid><description>&lt;p>The real time news cycle bothers me. Every time theres some news there are countless reactions on Twitter and quick, shoddy write ups on various &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; sites. Unfortunately, by the time someone does the research and writes a thoughtful response, we&amp;rsquo;ve moved on to the next piece of news. We&amp;rsquo;re reaching the point where writing something stupid quickly is becoming more valuable than writing something thoughtful but late.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twitter’s strength is its weakness. The 140 character limit makes it very easy for anyone to share an opinion but that also leads to everyone sharing an opinion. Of course, its ability to break and spread news is invaluable. I just wish that the more thoughtful, well-researched pieces could get past the noise. This week, I would have preferred to see a few insightful pieces about WWDC rather than the same exact WWDC coverage from dozens of sites.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On SEO: Authority vs Originality</title><link>/2013/05/29/on-seo-authority-vs-originality/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/05/29/on-seo-authority-vs-originality/</guid><description>&lt;p>A while ago I read Bruce Schneier’s Liars and Outliers and came across a neat passage:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>There was this kid who came from a poor family. He had no good options in life so he signed up for the military. After a few years he was deployed to a conflict infested, god-forsaken desert outpost. It was the worst tour of duty he could have been assigned. It was going to be hot and dangerous. Everyday he had to live with a hostile populace who hated his presence and the very sight of his uniform. Plus, the place was swarming with insurgents and terrorists.&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>Anyhow, one morning the soldier goes to work and finds that he's been assigned that day to a detail that is supposed to oversee the execution of three convicted insurgents. The soldier shakes his head. He didn't sign up for this. His life just totally sucks. "They don't pay me enough," he thinks, "for the shit I have to do."&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>He doesn't know he's going to be executing the Son of God that day. He's just going to work, punching the time clock, keeping his head down. He's just trying to stay alive, get through the day, and send some money back home to Rome.&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Bruce mentions that he found this on the internet and &lt;a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2011/06/tales-of-demonic.html" target="_blank">cited it appropriately&lt;/a> in the footnotes. But when I tried Googling for the phrase &amp;ldquo;There was this kid who came from a poor family&amp;rdquo; the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22there+was+this+kid+who+came+from+a+poor+family%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=%22there+was+this+kid+who+came+from+a+poor+family%22&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j62l3.268j0&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">top links&lt;/a> were &lt;a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/post/3dC8YohtSmaRMsjNnQcMXA" target="_blank">people citing&lt;/a> Liars and Outliers, including my own &lt;a href="https://readmill.com/dangoldin/reads/liars-and-outliers/highlights/kajlmg" target="_blank">highlight on Readmill&lt;/a>.

I’d play everything that I got my hands on and remember sharing floppy disks with school friends. Unfortunately, I was plagued by two issues that had pretty clever approaches: age verification and piracy protection.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="right10">
 &lt;img src="/image/lsl-bar.png" alt="Leisure Suit Larry" data-width="320" data-height="200" data-layout="responsive" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The first manifested itself in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry" target="_blank">Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/a>. I was as giddy as only a kid can be when I got my hands on it. Unfortunately, that went away when I was required to take an “age quiz” as soon as the game loaded. The age quiz consisted of a series of multiple questions that only an adult would be able to answer. These ranged from factual ones such as “Who recorded ‘Let it be’?” to comical ones such as “Do girls really have cooties?” I do have memories of playing it so I must have figured out some way around the verification. I must have either guesses correctly some of the time or took notes of the answers that allowed me to play.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Smart software; dumb hardware</title><link>/2013/04/24/smart-software-dumb-hardware/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/04/24/smart-software-dumb-hardware/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, three isolated events gave me a glimpse of how powerful mobile can be. Tech pundits have been saying that for a while now but experiencing it firsthand is definitely more convincing.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul class="bulleted">
 &lt;li>I went for a run with only my phone to keep me company. After my run was done, I wanted to grab a cup of iced coffee and realized that Starbucks gave me a free drink on my birthday. Downloading the app on my phone allowed me to get a drink without having cash or a wallet.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>While checking out at a grocery store, a friend showed me CardStar which allowed him to store all his loyalty cards on his phone. Since then, I’ve imported all my loyalty cards that have just been sitting in a drawer into my phone.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>After getting a Raspberry Pi and installing Raspbmc, I was able to use my phone as a remote control just by downloading an app.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These behaviors are different and yet they’re all converging on the phone. What they have in common is that &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html" target="_blank">software is replacing hardware&lt;/a>. Hardware doesn’t need to become smarter, it just needs to be able to sync with our phones which can do the heavy lifting. The functionality then becomes limited by software which can be updated more cheaply and quickly than the hardware. It also solves the problem of hardware companies trying to develop software that results in a terrible user experience. Do cars really need the ability to &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/01/07/ford.twitter/index.html" target="_blank">read a Twitter&lt;/a> feed? And if they do, why not just do it via a simple Bluetooth connection and an audio streaming app on a phone?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automatically add a “Follow on HN” link</title><link>/2013/04/15/automatically-add-a-follow-on-hn-link/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/04/15/automatically-add-a-follow-on-hn-link/</guid><description>&lt;p>This past weekend I wrote a &lt;a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/follow-discussion-hn" target="_blank">small jQuery plugin&lt;/a> that automatically inserts a “Follow this discussion on Hacker News” link on a recently submitted web page.

&lt;blockquote>Meanwhile, Phil Porter, who had worked with [Richard] Frenkiel on the original system, came up with a permanent answer to an interesting question. Should a cellular phone have a dial tone? Porter made a radical suggestion that it shouldn’t. A caller should dial a number and then push “send.” That way, the mobile caller would be less rushed; also, the call would be connected for a shorter time, thus putting less strain on the network. That this idea—dial, then send—would later prove crucial to texting technology was not even considered.
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It’s amazing that although this suggestion was made in 1971, we’re leveraging it more than 40 years later with text messaging. How many other technologies and businesses are built on top of SMS that wouldn’t have existed without this decision? I’m sure an SMS-like technology would have come along regardless of this decision but it still makes me wonder how significantly past technological decisions influence us in the present.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coke, Pepsi and Passover</title><link>/2013/04/05/coke-pepsi-and-passover/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/04/05/coke-pepsi-and-passover/</guid><description>&lt;div class="right10">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>During Passover, Coke and Pepsi sell sugar based versions of their sodas in order to stay kosher for Passover. These high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) free sodas are extremely popular and people stock up while they can. I don’t know whether this is due to the better taste, the nostalgia, or the limited supply but these sugar based versions are definitely more popular. I wonder what would happen if either Coke or Pepsi decided to go “all in” on sugar and launch a marketing campaign against HFCS based food and drinks. I’d love to look at the margins of sugar vs HFCS based sodas and see what the market share increase would need to be in order to offset the switch to sugar. My gut tells me that pursuing this strategy would be a win but the companies are too entrenched in their current process that it’s just not going to happen. Smaller soda manufacturers, such as Boylan, GuS, and Moxie, are growing by differentiating themselves from the big guys and are emphasizing the healthier ingredients. I’m hopeful that this will pressure Coke and Pepsi to make their soda healthier. Unfortunately, what’s more likely to happen is that they will just acquire the niche manufacturers position them to appeal to the more concious consumer, similar to what’s happening to &lt;a href="http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/the-big-brewers-brands/" target="_blank">craft breweries&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Email addresses are private?</title><link>/2013/03/24/email-addresses-are-private/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/03/24/email-addresses-are-private/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, Andrew “weev” Aurenheimer, was sentenced to 41 months for going through publicly accessible AT&amp;amp;T URLs which exposed the email address of 114,000 iPad owners.

&lt;p>I’m more interested in the fact that people still consider an email address to be private information (although I do realize that the leak also revealed iPad ownership information).

But over time, this will spread until it’s the dominant approach. It’s simply better. It may be more expensive to get a digital class together but it’s primarily an upfront cost that will be spent on getting the best lecturers, developing engaging lectures, and creating varied course content that’s optimized for different learning methods.

We’re wired to want to improve things and when we come across what we feel is an injustice we want to change it. Unfortunately, social media has made us lazy. Sharing something on Twitter or Facebook gives us the nice, warm feeling that we’re actively contributing to a cause. Instead of going out and demonstrating in public, snail mailing our representatives, or providing financial support, we’re clicking a link and think we’re making a difference. PIPA/SOPA wasn’t stopped due to internet outrage but from people calling their representatives and doing more than just mentioning their opposition. Wikipedia and Reddit didn’t just put a message up saying they oppose PIPA/SOPA but blacked out their site.

I’m publishing them publicly since that should help my motivation. I’m also calling them goals since a goal seems harder to abandon than a resolution. I’m hoping that having these goals be specific, however arbitrary, will also help me in achieving them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>
	&lt;b>Run 1000 miles in 2013&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
	I’ve gotten out of shape over the past couple of months and that’s a bad place to be in the late 20s. I think it’s important to get good habits now since that will help me maintain my health as I get older. Not to mention that being in better physical health will improve my acuity.
	&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>
	&lt;b>Write at least 2 blog posts a week&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
	The more I work with various people the more I realize the importance of communication. Writing doesn’t come easily to me and I spend the majority of time editing but I’m hoping that it’ll be easier by the end of 2013. And although writing is just one aspect of communication, improving that will lay a solid foundation for the others.
	&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>
	&lt;b>Meet up with 2 old acquaintances each month&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
	Going from a company with hundreds of employees to working with a cofounder reduces the number of people you have contact with. By restoring my old relationships I’ll be able to connect with old friends and strengthen my network. Something I’ve learned over the past year of meeting with various folk in the NYC startup community is to end every meeting with an offer to help and I’m going to adopt that attitude as well.
	&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>
	&lt;b>Develop 6 side projects&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
	This one’s here for a few reasons. One, I want to keep on improving and starting a project from scratch is a great way to work with new technologies and explore different approaches. There are many times that I want to go back to my existing code and rewrite it but why fix something that isn’t broken? Isn’t it better to put that energy into something new? Two, I want to give back to the community and putting these projects on GitHub will hopefully help someone. Three, this will just be a good outlet for when I need a break from the main gig. Four, I want to build my personal brand and having more more of my work publicly available will hopefully help.
	&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>
	&lt;b>Start a hands-on hobby&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
	This one stems from a personal belief that I just need to do something with my hands since I spend so much time in front of the computer. This may end up being drawing, painting or woodworking but the goal is to find something that allows me create something physical and not digital. I’ve already dug up some colored pencils and drawing paper and am in the process of signing up for a woodworking class at a hands-on coworking space in Brooklyn called &lt;a href="http://www.3rdward.com/">3rd Ward&lt;/a>.

Let’s start with a joke:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 An American consultant was at a pier in a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The Mexican replied "Only a little while." The consultant then asked why didn't he stay out longer and catch more fish? The fisherman said he had enough to support his family's immediate needs. Then the American asked how he spent the rest of his time.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The Mexican fisherman said, "I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Maria, and then stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, senor."&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The American consultant scoffed, "I am a very successful business consultant and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and, with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, and eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York City where you will run your expanding enterprise."&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The Mexican fisherman asked, "But senor, how long will this all take?"&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The consultant replied, "Probably 15 to 20 years."&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 "But what then, senor?" asked the fisherman.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The consultant laughed, and said, "That's the best part! When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public. You'll become very rich, you would make millions!"&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 "Millions, senor?" replied the Mexican. "Then what?"&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The American said, "Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos."

&lt;p>Other than the chuckle, this joke got me thinking about how people view work. The joke suggests that you should only work to support your life outside of work. If you work more than that then the joke’s on you since you’re sacrificing your personal life. This is view that you can’t have if you’re starting a company. Entrepreneurs need to combine their personal and professional lives. If you’re running a startup and aren’t thinking about the market, your product, or your users when you’re in the shower or in bed you’re doing it wrong. More importantly, this should be natural and not forced. If you don’t enjoy thinking about your startup when times are good, how will you be able to do it when times are tough (which they will be)? We need our passion to get over the humps so if you’re not passionate about your startup when you’re starting out, you will abandon it when facing challenges. Your startup will end up consuming you so why not pick something that you care about?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Achieving browser autocomplete</title><link>/2012/06/07/achieving-browser-autocomplete/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/06/07/achieving-browser-autocomplete/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/autocomplete.png" alt="Screenshot of date range tool in action" data-width="500" data-height="89" data-layout="responsive" />

In this post, I want to take a deeper look into why consumers are so much more comfortable with technology now compared to 20 years ago and try to see where this leads. Since customers are what cause our businesses to grow, we need to be cognizant of what drives their behavior in order to plan for the future. Wayne Gretzky’s father famously said “A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be” and I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to see where the consumer puck is going to be.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>To me, the major driver is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law" title="Moore's Law" target="_blank">Moore’s Law&lt;/a>. We’ve seen computation speeds double every 18 months for the past 50 years. This has obviously led to faster computers but has also led to exponentially reducing costs. This has been a huge economic driver and is allowing computers to be more accessible than ever. Our cellphones are more powerful than what was used to land on the moon. These increases in computation also led to the rise of the modern web. It went from being a military/academic project that dealt with text data to something that’s distributing pictures and videos to whoever is interested.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>More importantly, improvements in computation led to improvements in usability. Even if we had modern browser standards like CSS3 and HTML5 in the 1990s our computers would be too weak to handle them. We would not have any of the modern innovations (AJAX, DOM manipulation) and our web pages would be static without any rich media content. If we never got past the command line, how many people would have computers in their home? How many smartphones would exist? I’d argue that the usability improvements are what led to the massive consumer adoption of tech products. Of course, computation, cost, and usability are all intertwined but computation and cost alone would not have led to the consumer adoption we’ve seen.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>What does this mean for the future? I see usability becoming even more native with us not realizing that we’re even using a computer. We’re already seeing this emerging with Siri and Google Glasses. As long as our computation speeds continue to improve these technologies will become better and better and will recede more and more into the background. Of course, this is all dependent on Moore’s Law holding, with many saying the pace will decrease by 2020. I’m optimistic that we’ll come up with something but even if we don’t, as long as we computing costs keep on dropping, via &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey's_law" title="Koomey's Law" target="_blank">Koomey’s Law&lt;/a>, we should still see the benefits as we move more and more computation to the ever cheaper cloud. It’s difficult to imagine what would happen if our computation speeds stop increasing the way they have been over the past 50 years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Writing</title><link>/2012/04/04/on-writing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/04/04/on-writing/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;span>I recently made an effort to improve my writing and this blog gives me a great way to practice. I force myself to write at least two posts a week, even if it’s just a paragraph. Writing hasn’t come easy to me and I spent more than 20 years returning the favor. In high school, I rarely edited and a quick spell and grammar check was good enough for me. In college, I avoided the writing-heavy classes and the ones I did take I just followed my high school approach. Something changed when I started working. Although initially driven by my desire to perform, I started seeing writing as a challenging, creative process. I remember spending 30 minutes on a paragraph-long email before being comfortable enough to send it out. Even after only a few weeks, I feel that my writing has gotten better - both in terms of speed and clarity. I still have trouble writing long posts since I tend to go on tangents and lose focus.&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span>&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span>An issue I’m currently dealing with is deciding when something is “done.” I could always spend more time editing and rewriting but should I? How much editing is a good use of my time? Jack Kerouac wrote the first draft of On The Road in three weeks and the final draft in 20 days. On the other hand, T. S. Eliot wrote The Waste Land over a few years, with the drafts being almost twice as long. I fall somewhere in between. I realize that I learn better through struggle and forcing myself to edit and rewrite helps me in the long term. At the same time, I realize that I have a ton of other things to do and rewriting the same paragraph a dozen times is not the best use of my time. At the moment, I write and rewrite until I’m proud of what I have and hope that it will get easier in the future. As frustrating as it can get, it’s significantly easier than what people were doing only 20 years ago before computers. This thought helps me focus and slowly work my way up to the fabled 10,000 hours.&lt;/span>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overcoming the Build Bias</title><link>/2012/03/24/overcoming-the-build-bias/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/03/24/overcoming-the-build-bias/</guid><description>&lt;p>An issue I’ve been trying to overcome is what I like to call the “build bias.” Whenever I’d run into a technical problem, I’d want to solve it on my own - whether it’s by writing some code or by installing and configuring various libraries and packages. I remember the time I needed to collect feedback for a website but instead of just using an off the shelf product like &lt;a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/" title="GetSatisfaction" target="_blank">GetSatisfaction&lt;/a>, I decided to create my own. Although I was able to get it working, it took me longer than expected to get it into a usable state and distracted me from the other improvements I wanted to make.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>As a developer, it’s very easy to convince yourself to build from scratch every time you need something rather than using an existing solution. It’s exciting to work on something new and it’s annoying integrating someone else’s code. It’s even worse when they’re charging a few dollars a month for something that you can build in a few hours.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>More often than not we underestimate the cost of building something of sufficient quality and don’t include the ongoing maintenance cost we’ll most likely be doing. More importantly, we are no longer focusing on the highest leverage activity. As they teach in business schools, you shouldn’t outsource your core competency but everything else is fair game. This is also supported by the lean startup approach which encourages getting your product to market as soon as possible so you can validate your market hypotheses. Why spend time building features when you don’t even know you have a marketable product? If it does turn out that you have a successful product you can always go back and develop your own solution then.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>My new process is to first make sure that the feature is even needed. If it is, I check out the open source alternatives to see if anything can be used. If not, I look at the available paid solutions. For many small projects, it turns out that you can ride the trial/basic version enough to validate your idea. This approach has led &lt;a href="http://www.glos.si" title="Glossi" target="_blank">Glossi&lt;/a> to use &lt;a href="https://mongohq.com/home" title="MongoHQ" target="_blank">MongoHQ&lt;/a> to host my database, &lt;a href="http://sendgrid.com/" title="SendGrid" target="_blank">SendGrid&lt;/a> as my email system, and &lt;a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/" title="GetSatisfaction" target="_blank">GetSatisfaction&lt;/a> as a feedback widget in addition to ton of open source libraries. With every new project, I’m offloading more and more of my auxiliary features to cloud based services and feel much more productive. Makes me wonder how many other services there are out there that can be leveraged.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When is it time to leave the full time job?</title><link>/2012/03/21/when-is-it-time-to-leave-the-full-time-job/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/03/21/when-is-it-time-to-leave-the-full-time-job/</guid><description>&lt;p>A common question I get when telling my friends that I’m leaving my full time job to work on Glossi is “Why now?

&lt;p>I'm not entirely sure what to think about the GoDaddy/SOPA situation. On one hand, it's great that the online community was able to get GoDaddy to completely reverse their position on SOPA. On the other, it's disappointing that a web company would support it in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should we still be penalizing GoDaddy for their initial SOPA support or move on the same way they did? What type of example does this set for other companies? That they will be judged based on their original position and nothing after?

&lt;p>People often blame bad luck for their failures. This absolves them of responsibility and allows them to stop trying. What they should have done is admitted their failure, learned from the experience, and prepared themselves for the next opportunity. Exposing yourself to opportunities is the best way to overcome bad luck. Authors are a great example of this: J K Rowling and John Grisham had their novels rejected numerous times before they succeeded. Yet soon after publishing they became blockbusters. How many authors gave up when trying to have their work published? Imagine if they had the determination that J K Rowling and John Grisham had.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>More posts coming up</title><link>/2009/01/20/more-posts-coming-up/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2009/01/20/more-posts-coming-up/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy recently but have a bunch of topics that I want to write about so keep on checking.&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 &lt;li>Have at least 3 different passwords:
 &lt;ol>
 	&lt;li>E-mail Account&lt;/li>
 This account controls all your other accounts so protect it as much as you can. All other accounts can be accessed or reset if someone has access to your email.
 	&lt;li>Bank/Financial Accounts&lt;/li>
 These control your money so use a different password for these than for the rest of your accounts. In addition, you may want to keep your credit card account passwords separate from your bank accounts.
 	&lt;li>"Fun" Account&lt;/li>
 These may not be vital to your survival (unless you are a facebook addict) so a password compromise here may not affect you too much. In addition, these sites may not store your password as securely as the bank accounts so you don't want this password being the same as the other accounts.
 &lt;/ol>
 &lt;p>A good way to generate passwords is to contain some sort of "base" and add some prefixes or suffixes to it in order to come up with the password for the various sites. For example, I can have my base password be "orange". For financial sites my password will be "orangeFIN22", for my email it will be "orangeE33", etc. Then you don't have to remember an entirely different set of passwords yet they are distinct enough to avoid compromising all your accounts with a stolen password.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Privacy in the digital age</title><link>/2008/06/12/privacy-in-the-digital-age/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/06/12/privacy-in-the-digital-age/</guid><description>&lt;p>With so many people joining social networks like Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn, it's becoming harder and harder to protect your personal information. If one of your friends happens to add a host of different facebook apps, those apps will have access to his friends' (your) information. There is nothing you can do to stop this unless you either remove all your friends or create very limited profiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, people have come to expect to be able to add you as a friend after they've met you and rejecting them may be construed as anti-social. Imagine a recruiter not being able to look at your information on LinkedIn or a potential date not being able to look at your interests or photos on facebook - you will be missing out on opportunities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't judge words by their author</title><link>/2008/05/28/dont-judge-words-by-their-author/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/05/28/dont-judge-words-by-their-author/</guid><description>&lt;p>A common idiom is "Don't judge a book by its cover" but I think that in this modern age this needs to rehashed into "Don't judge words by their author."&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How often do we look at the author before we read an article or blog post? And how does this impact the way we absorb it? Studies have been done[1] to show that the same words coming from two different people, one a professor and one an average Joe, are interpreted differently: the professor is trusted while the average Joe is not. This can be expanded to any source of information, anything from a book to a YouTube video. In the past, these sources of information were concentrated - not everyone could write a book, but now anyone can start a blog to spread their thoughts and opinions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome</title><link>/2008/05/21/welcome/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/05/21/welcome/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I am porting this blog over from wordpress.com to my own local hosting.

You can make the same argument for any part of the interview process and I feel that brainteasers may even attract intelligent employees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can come up with a few good reasons to use brainteasers during an interview. One, you are able to determine how well the interviewee thinks as well as their problem solving ability. In addition, if the interviewee does end up getting a job offer, he or she may be more likely to accept it since it was a challenging interview and getting the job feels like an accomplishment - feels better when you have to earn something than when it falls into your lap. The fact that you even asked a brain teaser shows intelligence on your part and you want to attract people who want to work with other smart people, instead of being the big fish in a small pond.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Printers no longer come with cables?</title><link>/2008/05/13/printers-no-longer-come-with-cables/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/05/13/printers-no-longer-come-with-cables/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since when did printers stop coming with the cables?
