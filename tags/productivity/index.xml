Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s something here you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with and it might be enough to encourage you to give it a shot.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For the first half of the year I used Ubuntu on a ThinkPad X1 but switched back to a Macbook (Early 2019 Pro) due to a variety of stability issues. The keyboard isn&amp;rsquo;t as nice but I&amp;rsquo;m overall more productive and glad to have the Microsoft Office suite back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Giving Obsidian a shot</title><link>/2020/05/31/giving-obsidian-a-shot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/31/giving-obsidian-a-shot/</guid><description>&lt;p>I tried using Notion a while back but rebelled against having my data stored in the cloud in a proprietary format. For a &lt;a href="/2016/04/30/text-is-king/">variety of reasons&lt;/a> I want my notes to be available locally in a text based format. At the same time there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like about the modern tools and I feel myself being worn down. A few weeks ago I discovered &lt;a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam&lt;/a> and am sold on its networked thought model. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for some of my note taking but was hesitant to commit given my concerns. Earlier this week I came across &lt;a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian&lt;/a> - a Roam-like product that runs locally and stores everything in Markdown. This was opportune timing since I&amp;rsquo;m able to lean in on the networked thought model while still staying true to local files in an open format. I&amp;rsquo;m still getting used to Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s semantics - tags, links, and Markdown - but overall I&amp;rsquo;m bullish and glad to give it a shot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Embracing smartphone productivity</title><link>/2020/02/11/embracing-smartphone-productivity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/02/11/embracing-smartphone-productivity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Unlike a modern teenager, I tend to avoid using my smartphone for anything except consumption. I&amp;rsquo;d read emails but not respond, check up on Twitter but not tweet, look at my calendar but not schedule any events, and so forth. The excuse was that I&amp;rsquo;d be able to do these much more effectively in front of a real computer. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that while the above is true I can still knock out a ton of small and simple tasks on my phone and save the meaty stuff for the computer. I&amp;rsquo;m not much more willing to respond to an email or send an invite on my phone rather than waiting to get on a computer. It also has the side benefit of reducing the amount of items on my mental todo list which will inevitably have loss.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stop procrastinating</title><link>/2017/03/09/stop-procrastinating/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/03/09/stop-procrastinating/</guid><description>&lt;p>I often find myself wanting to postpone something but after forcing myself to actually do it I discover that most of the difficulty was getting over the postponement hump. Especially these days it’s very easy to get distracted - whether it’s checking your email, responding to a few tweets, or clearing notifications on Slack - but it’s important to just focus on the most important task at hand. After starting you discover that the task wasn’t worth delaying and get an energy boost from actually finishing something.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
