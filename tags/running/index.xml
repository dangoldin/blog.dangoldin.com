I’ve never been into running until the beginning of this year when I decided to run 1000 miles. This led to me to three half marathons and is actually making me consider doing a full one. It’s amazing where a habit and a bit of effort can take you.</description></item><item><title>My running progress</title><link>/2013/10/13/my-running-progress/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/10/13/my-running-progress/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure why, but I started off 2013 with the goal of running 1000 miles which breaks down into a little more than 19 miles a week. Remarkably, I stuck with it and am somehow at 822 miles for the year and need to average 16/week for the remainder of 2013 to hit the goal. Yet it took me a surprisingly long time to work up to a weekly distance of 19 miles and even longer to consistently run more than 19 miles a week.</description></item></channel></rss>
