Want to divide by 5? Multiply by 2 and shift decimal point.</description></item><item><title>Math is incredible</title><link>/2017/02/19/math-is-incredible/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/02/19/math-is-incredible/</guid><description>Maybe I never learned this or maybe I forgot but while reading Prime Obsession I came across a concept that blew my mind. We all learn about infinite series and how some converge (think 1 + ½ + ¼ + .. = 2) and some diverge (1 + ½ + ⅓ + ¼ + ..) but it turns out that not all convergent series are the same. The same numbers, added in a different order, can lead to a different resulting sum.</description></item></channel></rss>
