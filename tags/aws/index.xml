I knew AWS was massive but this came as a big shock so I decided to do some digging around. I came across a site that listed the market prices of IP addresses and the range looks to be anywhere from $20 to $30 per IP depending on the block size.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing AWS reservations</title><link>/2020/07/08/optimizing-aws-reservations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/07/08/optimizing-aws-reservations/</guid><description>The Information has an article making the case that Uber was better off having their own data centers versus relying on the cloud given the impact of COVID but that would depend on their reservation strategy. Sure if they reserved AWS capacity then they would be on the hook. Alternatively, if they had no reservations and were running everything on demand they would have incurred higher previous costs but would immediately be able to shut things down.</description></item><item><title>AWS 101</title><link>/2020/06/19/aws-101/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/06/19/aws-101/</guid><description>Earlier this week I hosted an &amp;ldquo;AWS 101&amp;rdquo; session at work. The goal was to give a small group an interactive introduction to the primary AWS services over 90 minutes. I figure I&amp;rsquo;d share our agenda and exercises in case they&amp;rsquo;re helpful to anyone else. We had trouble sticking to the times but the fact that everyone was remote did make it easier to do group-debugging with those stuck sharing their screens.</description></item><item><title>AWS EC2 instance arbitrage</title><link>/2016/03/05/aws-ec2-instance-arbitrage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/05/aws-ec2-instance-arbitrage/</guid><description>While reserving some EC2 instances earlier this week I discovered that Amazon allows you to sell reserved instances you’re no longer using. Usually the prices the third parties are offering are very close to the fair market value but I wondered if there was an arbitrage opportunity by reserving a longer term instance and selling it for a series of shorter term leases. The typical discount for buying a 1 year reserved instance is 30% while buying one for 3 years can get over 60%.</description></item><item><title>Symptom based monitoring</title><link>/2014/12/01/symptom-based-monitoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/12/01/symptom-based-monitoring/</guid><description>A month or so ago I read Rob Ewaschuk’s philosophy on alerting and since then I’ve been trying to be more aware of the alerts we have and whether any can be improved. The most actionable insight was to start thinking in terms of “symptom-based monitoring” where the alerts should reflect what the users are experiencing rather than various issues along the tech stack. This aligns your alerts with user expectations and can also simplify alerting since they will all be running at a high level.</description></item><item><title>AWS Glacier</title><link>/2014/10/12/aws-glacier/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/10/12/aws-glacier/</guid><description>I’ve been trying to reduce the amount of stuff I have and a big part of it is old electronics. I’ve been selling off old headphones and random cables but the one thing that’s been more difficult to get rid of is older hard drives. I know that most of the stuff on them is junk that I’ll never see again but it’s still tough to just throw it away. They’re reminders of previous jobs and old projects that are a part of my identity that are tough to permanently delete with a click.</description></item><item><title>AWS is about infrastructure optionality</title><link>/2014/03/30/aws-is-about-infrastructure-optionality/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/03/30/aws-is-about-infrastructure-optionality/</guid><description>Every time Amazon announces a price drop there are always people pointing out that it’s still more expensive than other cloud computing services such as Linode or Digital Ocean. The Amazon fans then respond by saying sure AWS is more expensive but the value is the ability to scale quickly when needed.
For me, the biggest value behind AWS is the ecosystem and the included optionality. When building large scale web services it’s tough to know every issue you will run into and more often than not your needs and implementation will change.</description></item><item><title>Developing on a remote instance</title><link>/2014/01/23/developing-on-a-remote-instance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/01/23/developing-on-a-remote-instance/</guid><description>One of the first things I was given when joining TripleLift was a Macbook Air and an Amazon EC2 instance to do my development work on. Before that, every company I worked at would give me a pretty powerful computer so that I’d be able to do my development work locally. At first, coding on a remote instance took some getting used to but now I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of this approach.</description></item><item><title>RDS and R</title><link>/2013/11/15/rds-and-r/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/11/15/rds-and-r/</guid><description>In my quest to replace Excel with R I’ve been spending the past week trying to do everything in R. It hasn’t been that easy with many things taking longer due to me having to reference the R docs but one thing that’s been great so far is being able to quickly run a query on Amazon’s RDS and pull data into a data frame for quick analysis. Being able to wrap this into a reusable function makes things even better.</description></item><item><title>Splitting an AWS account</title><link>/2013/08/24/splitting-an-aws-account/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/08/24/splitting-an-aws-account/</guid><description>When we launched Pressi, I had it set up under my personal AWS account. Recently, we needed to move it into a separate AWS account and I wanted to share the steps to help others running into the same issue. Unsurprisingly, most of the effort went into planning and figuring out the migration steps and order in which they should be done. We weren’t able to eliminate downtime entirely but we reduced it as much as we could.</description></item><item><title>Mmmm... pseudo static sites</title><link>/2013/03/12/mmmm...-pseudo-static-sites/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/03/12/mmmm...-pseudo-static-sites/</guid><description>Reading Katie Zhu’s post on NPR’s news app architecture got me curious about a setup where most of the content is static and can be hosted on S3 and EC2 is primarily used to generate the static content which is then uploaded to S3. The benefits were obvious:
Cost: S3 is cheaper than EC2. Reliable: S3 doesn’t go down near as frequently as EC2. Scalable: Since it’s primarily static you don’t have to worry about additional capacity or dealing with caching, databases, and all the other fun things.</description></item></channel></rss>
