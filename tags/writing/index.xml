Lately it&amp;rsquo;s been learning the modern Django stack and discovering it&amp;rsquo;s multiple major versions ahead of the last time I used it. But thanks to the wonders of the modern internet there&amp;rsquo;s a ton of content online that explains how to do certain tasks. Stack Overflow is one but there are also a ton of individual bloggers and tutorials that make it easier than ever to answer questions.</description></item><item><title>Prefer verbs to adverbs</title><link>/2020/05/21/prefer-verbs-to-adverbs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/21/prefer-verbs-to-adverbs/</guid><description>Years ago I read a book that I unfortunately can&amp;rsquo;t recall that had a very insightful bit of writing advice - prefer verbs to adverbs. The premise was that many of us will spice up our writing by using adverbs to decorate our verbs but instead we should use strong and unique verbs. Your writing gains pithiness and leads to a more memorable message.
As an example, rather than prepending &amp;ldquo;said&amp;rdquo; with yet another adverb instead think of verbs that get your point across better - maybe it&amp;rsquo;s shouted, or exclaimed, or charged, or yelled, or accused, or hundreds others.</description></item></channel></rss>
