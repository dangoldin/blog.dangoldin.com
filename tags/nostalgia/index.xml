I had a whole cat-and-mouse routine going on with my parents. They would put a BIOS boot password on the computer and I would open up the case, remove the battery, and reset the BIOS settings. They would lock the basement, where our one and only computer was located, and I would climb in through the window. They would lock the door to the computer room and I would undo the door hinges. It was difficult stopping me but remarkably I outgrew them and am now a somewhat well-adjusted member of society.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
