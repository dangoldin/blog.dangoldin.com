I expected it to come with more privacy features but one that surprised me was an alert that apps wanted to &amp;ldquo;find and connect to devices on your local network.&amp;rdquo; This is an obvious one Apple covered this functionality during &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10110/">WWDC&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting seeing which apps request this permission and speculate why.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
