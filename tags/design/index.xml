Perversely, this makes sense. If economy is only slightly worse than business then I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to save quite a bit of money by choosing economy for a worse experience. Yet if the economy seats were significantly worse then I&amp;rsquo;d pay a premium for business. The art is in figuring out what that threshold should be to fill every seat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Combine registration and sign in</title><link>/2019/07/02/combine-registration-and-sign-in/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/02/combine-registration-and-sign-in/</guid><description>&lt;p>The goal of nearly every site or app is to get users to engage as quickly as possible. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s surprising that so many sites have a separate flow for registration versus sign in. There&amp;rsquo;s no good reason that these two flows shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be combined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A part of nearly every registration is entering an email and password so why not make them the first step of the sign up process? If that email and password are already in the system just log her in. And if not then you have the email address of a to-be-registered user. The only real risk is if someone thought they had an account and wanted to sign in but instead signed up - and that&amp;rsquo;s a good problem to have from the application side since you have the contact info of an interested user.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LinkedIn's terrible messaging experience</title><link>/2019/03/10/linkedins-terrible-messaging-experience/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/03/10/linkedins-terrible-messaging-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a bit of a ranty post but it’s incredible how poor the LinkedIn messaging experience is. If anyone sends me a LinkedIn message I get an email telling me that so-and-so sent me a message. To read the actual message I need to clickthrough to get to the LinkedIn site. I get it, they want to increase engagement and have me access the site and show me something new. It’s just a ridiculously poor user experience. They could easily include the message text and then I can decide whether it’s something I need to respond to and when. Instead I get a useless notification telling me that I have a new message. It’s as if the LinkedIn message experience was modeled after AOL’s “you’ve got mail.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon's "Add to list" design</title><link>/2018/12/27/amazons-add-to-list-design/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/27/amazons-add-to-list-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>I use Amazon’s wish list as a placeholder of books I plan on buying. I’m not sure why I don’t just buy them immediately but whenever I’m done with a book I go to my wish list and purchase a new one. Earlier today while adding two books to my wish list I noticed something odd: the location of the “Add to list” button was different from one page to the next. Amazon is the premier ecommerce company and must be doing a ton of A/B testing to optimize the design of the site so it’s surprising that the button is in two completely different locations. I was in the same browser session as well so it’s not as if they’re randomizing it per session; instead it’s as if they’re just showing me two completely different designs for two different products.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A UX gem in Google Slides</title><link>/2018/11/13/a-ux-gem-in-google-slides/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/13/a-ux-gem-in-google-slides/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m a sucker for subtle UX gems and Google continues to amaze me. While working on a presentation using the Slides product I had to modify the colors of a few objects. The UX for this is usually pretty normal - you select the object, hit the icon to modify the color, and choose a new color. Usually it’s slightly better and you get to see the existing color. What surprised me with the Google Slides experience is that I didn’t just see the existing color but also saw the previously picked color. Since I was modifying a series of objects to the same color this was a pleasant experience, especially since I was working off of a series of color shades that looked too similar. It would have been even better if I was able to bulk change the objects but a win’s a win.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design anti pattern: Tab switching autosave</title><link>/2018/01/23/design-anti-pattern-tab-switching-autosave/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/01/23/design-anti-pattern-tab-switching-autosave/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every once in awhile I get frustrated by a product experience and turn it into a design anti pattern rant. This time it was updating a bit of information in JIRA, switching to a different tab to look something up, and then going back to realize that my change was saved. Sure it was simple to edit and update the field but it seems the field should have just stayed in edit-mode until I was explicitly done. Since then I’ve been keeping an eye on how many products fall into this trap and it’s a fair amount. In the pursuit of improving efficiency they’re actually hurting it. Many tasks require referencing something else and I suspect there’s a bit of local optimization happening here with them focusing solely on their own product and not where it fits in to someone’s overall workflow.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Google Docs efficiency win</title><link>/2017/07/24/a-google-docs-efficiency-win/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/07/24/a-google-docs-efficiency-win/</guid><description>&lt;div class="right10">

&lt;p>I’m an efficiency fiend and love seeing my heavily used products updated with any and all functionality that make them a tad easier to use. A few weeks ago, Google Docs, one of my most heavily used applications - in fact where I’m writing this very post - made a minor change to the “Move to” functionality that created one of these small efficiency wins. Before the change, clicking the small folder icon while in a document would show a menu with the item’s current location and a “Move this item” option. Clicking that behavior would enable move mode and would require the user to navigate to the appropriate folder and then confirming the move.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Slack's channel exit anti pattern</title><link>/2017/04/02/slacks-channel-exit-anti-pattern/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/04/02/slacks-channel-exit-anti-pattern/</guid><description>&lt;p>Slack has grown incredibly quickly and solves a difficult problem but I can’t help but notice that some design antipatterns that increase Slack usage but don’t benefit the user.

&lt;p>Wanting to avoid a busy lunch rush but hankering for Chipotle I decided to download their app to order ahead. It’s a straightforward app and everything went as expected until I had to enter the expiration date for my credit card. The way the app is set up is that you’re expected to choose the month first followed by the year. Unfortunately it prevents you from picking a month in the past. One can probably guess what problem this leads to: if the expiration date is in the future but the expiration month is before today’s month the app rejects the month change until you change the year. The screenshot illustrates the design.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The corporate email signup design pattern</title><link>/2016/04/13/the-corporate-email-signup-design-pattern/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/04/13/the-corporate-email-signup-design-pattern/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the latest trends I’ve noticed is B2B companies is allowing you to sign up with a company email address and automatically linking you with the rest of the organization. This is a definite no-brainer and a really simple way of getting new users setup without having to be bottlenecked by a burdensome administrative process. No one on the HR team has to enter employees into the system nor send anyone their username or account info. Instead they just provide a link to the service and have people sign up with their company email address. Once this is done they immediately have access to whatever the base employee account should have. Only later one does an admin need to grant additional permissions and privileges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why login after resetting your password?</title><link>/2015/03/24/why-login-after-resetting-your-password/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/03/24/why-login-after-resetting-your-password/</guid><description>&lt;p>I can’t figure out why nearly every website forces you to login after resetting your password. It’s an extra step that adds nothing to security and introduces friction into the experience. The fact that I just entered my password into a form field should be enough to trigger the authentication flow and get me back into the app. The only reasons I can think of that it’s a way to confirm that the person actually remembers their new password or that the functionality just hasn’t been built. The former case doesn’t make sense - the fact that they forgot their password indicates they rarely use the site and will just forget it again by their next login attempt. It’s easier to just give them the immediate access and have them reset their password later. An even better approach would be to just have them enter the same password twice to make sure they match. The latter reason is just sloth - the engineering effort would be minimal and it would improve the experience and mood of the users who are already frustrated after multiple failed login attempts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why log me out?</title><link>/2014/12/16/why-log-me-out/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/12/16/why-log-me-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>Now that fantasy football season is over for me and I have no risk of angering the fantasy football gods I can complain about an interface decision in the Yahoo Fantasy Football Android app. Every once in a while the app will sign me out, which I suspect is a security feature, but I can log back in without having to re-enter a password. The only effect this “feature” has is getting me annoyed. The app has clean and simple visual design but that shouldn’t be prioritized over actual usability. Hopping between apps is such a common task that developers should strive to make it as painless as possible. This may involve changing the views around to make them more light weight or figuring out a way to simulate behavior without having to show a loading screen but it definitely makes the app feel snappier and more responsive.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An eBay design rant: timezone support</title><link>/2014/06/12/an-ebay-design-rant-timezone-support/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/06/12/an-ebay-design-rant-timezone-support/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/ebay-start-time.png" alt="eBay start time" data-width="556" data-height="93" data-layout="responsive" />
&lt;p>I recently needed to sell something on eBay and encountered an issue I thought they would have taken care of by now. Apparently you can pick the start time for an auction but it has to be in PDT - there’s no way to choose another time zone. The change is trivial and one would think that a $60B company would be able to support multiple time zones in their core product. Someone brought this up in &lt;a href="http://community.ebay.com/t5/My-eBay/HOW-DO-I-CHANGE-THE-TIMEZONE/td-p/2675835" target="_blank">the forums&lt;/a> in 2012 and it turns out that time zone support is only present in the forum to allow users to see posts with a local time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Logging in through your inbox</title><link>/2014/05/20/logging-in-through-your-inbox/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/05/20/logging-in-through-your-inbox/</guid><description>&lt;p>MixPanel has a clever way of handling failed login attempts. Instead of locking the user out of the account or forcing a password reset they send an email with two links - one to log in to the account directly and another to reset the password. I don’t recall ever seeing this approach before and wish more sites started doing it. This approach also obviates the need to even have a password - a site can just send a “login link” for an entered email address and the user can login via their inbox. This is similar to the way we login via the various social networks but instead of being sent to a social network for confirmation we are sent to our inbox. The only friction is having to go to your inbox to click on the link but since most people keep their inboxes open all day I don’t see this as a huge problem. The other advantage is security - most people use the same password across multiple sites so if one is compromised the others become vulnerable. Under this approach each site will have its own security controls and it becomes impossible for one site’s shoddy security to affect another’s. This is probably too drastic of a change for most users but I’d love to see sites start embracing this model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Bank of America, why?</title><link>/2013/12/20/why-bank-of-america-why/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/12/20/why-bank-of-america-why/</guid><description>&lt;p>Before leaving for a trip to India, I wanted to make sure that I’d be allowed to access the ATM so I decided to contact my bank.

Whereas before I might have gotten frustrated about some behavior, I’m now starting to get annoyed whenever I encounter something that’s obviously crummy. Here’s a few of the more recent design anti-patterns I’ve been noticing.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
 &lt;li>Submitting a login form with the wrong password removes the entered email address. Especially on mobile, where it both takes longer to type and typos are more common, it’s crappy having to type both my email and password again if I made a simple typo in my password or just don’t know which of my passwords I used. A quick hack I saw that makes this a bit easier is to add a keyboard shortcut to your phone to replace “@@” (or any other character set) with your email address.&lt;/li>

 &lt;img src="/image/bad-ui-contact-management.png" alt="Bad UI: Contact management" data-width="640" data-height="960" data-layout="responsive" />
 &lt;/div>
 Confusing placement of sign in and register. I forget which app I saw this in but as you can screen from the screenshot I’m on the sign in screen and yet the button under the form is to register, which causes the app to load the registration screen. The sign in button is up top which is a confusing flow since the user goes down the page first before having to go back to the top. The fact that the app uses a flat UI makes this worse since there’s not a lot of differentiation between the sign in and register actions.
 &lt;/li>
 &lt;li>
 &lt;div class="right10">
 &lt;img src="/image/bad-ui-contact-management.png" alt="Bad UI: Contact management" data-width="640" data-height="960" data-layout="responsive" />
 &lt;/div>
 Create new versus add to existing contact. This is probably the most “first-world” one here but without knowing who is currently in your address book it’s impossible to know whether you want to create a new contact or update an existing and contact. My current approach is to choose add to existing, realize that I actually don’t have that contact in my address book, and then go back a few screens and choose create new. A common database operation is “insert or update” - insert if it doesn’t already exist and update if it does. I’d love to have something like that to manage my address book.
 &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Design anti pattern: footer under infinite scroll</title><link>/2013/09/03/design-anti-pattern-footer-under-infinite-scroll/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/09/03/design-anti-pattern-footer-under-infinite-scroll/</guid><description>&lt;ul class="thumbnails">

 &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I’m not sure why this needs to be said but if your site offers infinite scroll make sure you don’t have anything clickable in the footer. I’d expect the occasional site to succumb to this but I was surprised to see it happening on LinkedIn. All I wanted to do was read the developer docs but unfortunately the link is located in the footer which provides a nice challenge of clicking the link before new content is loaded. I wasn’t quite able to get it and ended up just searching Google for the LinkedIn documentation link. If your site’s content is only accessible via a Google search you have a problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Simplicity vs power in product design</title><link>/2013/08/28/simplicity-vs-power-in-product-design/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/08/28/simplicity-vs-power-in-product-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>Although I come from a backend background, I’ve been spending more and more time on the UX side of things and have been picking up quite a bit - a combination of using Twitter Bootstrap on my projects, subscribing to the Hack Design lectures, and following a ton of designers on Twitter.&lt;/p>

A great design may lead to an increase in your vanity metrics but that won’t necessarily translate into a successful business. In fact, it’s likely that these low-value users will increase your costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we redesigned the landing page for Pressi (formerly Glossi) we saw the signup rate from our landing page shoot up to to close to 34% from below 5%. Unfortunately, our retention rates were abysmal and we were stuck supporting thousands of Pressi pages that were not seeing any engagement. This led to a massive increase in our AWS costs that we had to scramble to contain. The solution was to be smarter about the frequency of our data pulling as well as minimizing the amount of data we were storing for our users. In hindsight, we should have solved our retention problem before trying to grow our users but we were too obsessed with our user growth numbers to do the right thing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Save my reading spot, damn it</title><link>/2013/05/22/save-my-reading-spot-damn-it/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/05/22/save-my-reading-spot-damn-it/</guid><description>&lt;div class="right10">

&lt;p>When reading a long form piece, I favor the single-page view. Unfortunately, I usually don’t find out that it’s longer than a page until I’ve finished the first page. At that point, I switch to the single page view which causes the entire page to reload and I have to skim the page to find the spot where I stopped reading.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The new Gmail compose</title><link>/2013/04/02/the-new-gmail-compose/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/04/02/the-new-gmail-compose/</guid><description>&lt;div class="right10">

And for the vast majority of the time, it’s better: it’s quicker to get to and makes it easy to reference other emails while writing a new one. Unfortunately, for attaching an image (not embedding it inline) or doing some heavy formatting, it’s a huge step backwards and makes me want the old compose back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcoming the long, single webpage</title><link>/2013/03/26/welcoming-the-long-single-webpage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/03/26/welcoming-the-long-single-webpage/</guid><description>&lt;p>A recent trend in website design I’ve been seeing is the long single page.

It runs the gamut from non-profit &lt;a href="http://www.weheartwifi.com/" target="_blank">causes&lt;/a> to video game &lt;a href="http://www.sandboxstrat.com/" target="_blank">PR firms&lt;/a>. In fact, we’re even using this approach for the Makers Alley &lt;a href="https://makersalley.com/" target="_blank">homepage&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Surprisingly, it’s starting to make inroads on news sites as well. Whereas before news sites would have an article spread across 20 pages (looking at you Business Insider) in order to increase page views and show more ads, some news outlets are actually improving the user experience. Both &lt;a href="http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/" target="_blank">NPR&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/sports/wp/2013/02/27/cyclings-road-forward/" target="_blank">Washington Post&lt;/a> have posted pieces that leverage this approach and it creates a significantly more engaging read. It’s a pleasure reading long form content this way, richer media adds to the experience and minimizing mouse clicks avoids the disruption of a page load.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>App Store, what took so long?</title><link>/2013/03/01/app-store-what-took-so-long/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/03/01/app-store-what-took-so-long/</guid><description>&lt;p>In old versions of the iOS App Store, every time you downloaded a new app it would close the App Store and navigate to the screen with the now-downloading app. Recent versions of the App Store keep it open and force you explicitly exit.

&lt;p>The combination of taking the subway every day and reading design books had me thinking of ways to improve the subway user experience, other than the obvious one of making it cleaner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that struck me is the feeling you get when you see the train leaving the station. It&amp;#8217;s annoyingly stressful and makes me wonder how long I have to wait until the next train comes. Anything that can avoid this outcome would make waiting for the train a better experience. A way to do this is to limit the sensory feedback provided by seeing and hearing it leave. To avoid seeing the train until the last minute, subway stations can be designed to have stairs that need to be climbed in order to get to the platform. This way, the train and track will be hidden until the platform is reached. Making the train quieter would reduce the noise and prevent you from being aware that a train has left.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
