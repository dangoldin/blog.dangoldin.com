I don’t know whether my expectations are higher than the typical guests but in a significant number of my stays the wifi has been spotty. Rather than complain or just accept it I’ve started doing my own simple wifi network maintenance to help improve the speed. The nice thing thing is that this is entirely doable - both because you can connect to the network but also because you have access to the physical router.</description></item><item><title>Paris versus New York City</title><link>/2016/01/03/paris-versus-new-york-city/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/01/03/paris-versus-new-york-city/</guid><description>I just got back from a 10 day vacation in Paris and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but compare it against New York. That&amp;rsquo;s what traveling does - forces you to compare what you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with the novelty you&amp;rsquo;re exposed to. Some make you appreciate what you have while others make you want more. In any case I wanted to share my thoughts while they&amp;rsquo;re still fresh.
Public transit: One of the first things you notice after living in New York are the public transit systems in other cities.</description></item></channel></rss>
