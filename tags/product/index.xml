I got the chance to do the same thing for Instacart a few days ago when the receipt was included alongside the delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The markup wasn&amp;rsquo;t as significant or variable as the food delivery apps and was just over 9% for the majority of items. I imagine the intention was to keep it single digit in case anyone did the math and 10% does seem like a reasonable markup - even with the additional tip.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Slack Idea: Hierarchical Channels</title><link>/2021/02/14/slack-idea-hierarchical-channels/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 15:32:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>/2021/02/14/slack-idea-hierarchical-channels/</guid><description>&lt;p>While there are a lot of strong opinions about Slack on both sides, it clearly changed the way work gets done. I&amp;rsquo;m mixed. I appreciate the ability to quickly drop a question or response asynchronous yet acknowledge how disruptive it is and prevents deep work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The one thing that I did notice in our usage of Slack is that quite often the same message ends up being posted across multiple channels due to relevance for multiple groups. Yet many members exist in both groups and the repetition is redundant and inefficient. What if Slack had a way to have hierarchical channels?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clubhouse as a solution to Deepfakes</title><link>/2021/01/31/clubhouse-as-a-solution-to-deepfakes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 23:37:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>/2021/01/31/clubhouse-as-a-solution-to-deepfakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>My mind started wandering while half-listening to a Clubhouse discussion and I had the thought that Clubhouse - and generally any real time communication app - can end up being a solution to Deepfakes. At some point Deepfakes will be good enough to render in real time but until then having synchronous communication is a way to confirm the authenticity of the participants. On top of that I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can find some blockchain way to authenticate the session to prove that it was done live and was unaltered.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Billion dollar features</title><link>/2021/01/22/billion-dollar-features/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2021/01/22/billion-dollar-features/</guid><description>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/drew-houston-dropbox-steve-jobs-2017-6">old story&lt;/a> of Steve Jobs meeting Drew Houston in order to acquire Dropbox but after being refused calling Dropbox a feature.

Even worse, this additional fee is usually a function of your existing spend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I understand the rationale - there needs to be a cost to support otherwise everyone has an incentive to escalate and spend is likely correlated with complexity and volume of services used but it just feels as if I&amp;rsquo;m being nickel and dimed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blame the algorithm</title><link>/2020/12/19/blame-the-algorithm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/19/blame-the-algorithm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Stanford Medicine is in the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/18/948176807/stanford-apologizes-after-vaccine-allocation-leaves-out-nearly-all-medical-resid">news&lt;/a> for using an &amp;ldquo;algorithm&amp;rdquo; and allocating minimal COVID vaccines to those actually on the frontlines.

The reality is that unless you&amp;rsquo;re running at massive scale (Google or Facebook) your problems are more to do with big money rather than big data. It&amp;rsquo;s expensive to store, process, and expose terabytes and the difficulty is in doing it cost effectively, not in simply doing it.

I&amp;rsquo;m being a bit unfair since dark mode can also be a fun side project that someone picks up and may only require changing a few colors around but if it&amp;rsquo;s anything more than that it&amp;rsquo;s an indicator that something is off with their prioritization. Unless a product has reached the mature stage there are incredibly valuable things that the team can be investing in that actually improve the workflow and experience for their customers - dark mode is rarely that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shopify for food delivery</title><link>/2020/05/21/shopify-for-food-delivery/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/21/shopify-for-food-delivery/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wrote about the idea of a service that &lt;a href="http://dangoldin.com/2018/11/29/a-delivery-aggregation-service/">aggregates delivery drivers&lt;/a> back in 2018 but given the latest wave of food delivery service bashing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of it again. This time around my thoughts are a bit more refined about how to actually build a business but do think there&amp;rsquo;s a real opportunity here, especially after seeing the challenges with the current model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The existing food delivery apps charge high fees because food delivery is one of the highest costs. That’s the part that needs to be improved in order for the companies to make sense. As many people note restaurants have been delivering food on their own for decades while maintaining profitability so it&amp;rsquo;s clearly possible. Yet these online services struggle. Instead of focusing on the delivery side they&amp;rsquo;re in a race to capture as much of the demand as possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A TikTok experience for streaming services</title><link>/2020/03/29/a-tiktok-experience-for-streaming-services/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/03/29/a-tiktok-experience-for-streaming-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>During an &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/an-interview-with-eugene-wei-about-the-half-life-of-information/">interview&lt;/a> with Ben Thomson, &lt;a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/">Eugene Wei&lt;/a> has the following response to a question digging into Netflix solving the &amp;ldquo;I just want something on in the background&amp;rdquo; use case:&lt;/p>

 &lt;p>Yeah, that’s a great point. I also do hope that this macro shock forces the streaming companies to think a little bit harder about innovating on their user interfaces. I still think it’s a little bit of a shame that most of them still present the grid of icons.

&lt;p>I saw an ad for a specific &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/hudsonvalleyairbnb/">Airbnb&lt;/a> on Instagram and just don&amp;rsquo;t understand the economics. It seems unlikely that running this sort of campaign ends up being profitable. I&amp;rsquo;d expect the overlap between the audience targeted and those interested in booking the Airbnb to be extremely low and potentially non-existent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This Airbnb has a nightly rate of ~$350 and a cleaning fee of $199. If we assume that the average guest books for 3 nights the host is getting ~$1,220 after Airbnb fees ($350 * 0.97 * 3 + $199). Let&amp;rsquo;s also assume that the mortgage, maintenance, and utilities are $5,000/month with an aggressive occupancy rate of 75%. That leads us to an actual monthly profit of $2,638 ($350 * 30 * 0.97 * 0.75 - $5000) across 7.5 (30 * 0.75/3) guests, or a per guest profit of $351.73 ($2,638 / 7.5).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Self hosted, externally managed</title><link>/2019/12/31/self-hosted-externally-managed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/31/self-hosted-externally-managed/</guid><description>&lt;p>A couple of days ago I &lt;a href="/2019/12/27/whos-hosting-whos-managing/">wrote&lt;/a> about two questions one can ask when it comes to working with a technology vendor: who&amp;rsquo;s hosting and who&amp;rsquo;s managing?&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s pretty similar to the native swipe keyboard offered within iOS but it&amp;rsquo;s just a tad more accurate - especially for shorter words.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who's hosting?

Given this volume comparisons start to become easier and patterns start to emerge. One that I noticed is the gamut of hosting options as well as managed options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For hosting options, you can choose either the self-hosted option where the software is deployed to your own infrastructure. Alternatively, you can pay the vendor to deploy the code to their infrastructure and expose it through the necessary interfaces.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In praise of the simple tech stack</title><link>/2019/12/26/in-praise-of-the-simple-tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/26/in-praise-of-the-simple-tech-stack/</guid><description>&lt;p>These days it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to feel as if you&amp;rsquo;re falling behind the tech curve.

This is shocking given how dominant Disney currently is and it&amp;rsquo;s incredible that it came that close to being broken up and sold as individual pieces. Luckily, Disney withstood the attempt but this was a wakeup call that led to Michael Eisner rekindling the Disney magic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/11/Walt-Disney-Productions-ended-financier-Saul-Steinbergs-takeover-attempt/1284455774400/">ton written&lt;/a> about the attempt by people better suited but what I find fascinating is that the entire breakup attempt goes against the entire strategy Walt Disney put together in 1957. The entire strategy is incredible and is still in play right now. The core are the movies and shows that Disney produces which then drive every other channel. The power of strong and compelling content creates adjacent opportunities that then feed the next generation of great content. It&amp;rsquo;s sad and scary to think what would have happened had Disney been broken up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TabNine</title><link>/2019/12/15/tabnine/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/15/tabnine/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m a heavy Visual Studio Code user and one of my favorite plugins has been &lt;a href="https://tabnine.com/">TabNine&lt;/a>.

The primary reason was for The Mandalorian but I&amp;rsquo;m also enjoying The Imagineering Story and access to The Simpsons archive. My biggest surprise was how polished it all was. It&amp;rsquo;s a brand new product and it&amp;rsquo;s impressive what the team has done. It had a few hiccups at launch has but has been extremely smooth since then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use it on the Fire TV Stick so can’t speak to the other platforms but it&amp;rsquo;s simpler, and yet more polished than Netflix. It doesn’t have any of the autoplay nonsense that Netflix and Amazon Prime shove down your throat. It also keeps the order of shows consistent across sessions which makes navigation a breeze. Yet my favorite feature so far is the keyboard less login and being able to do it solely from your phone. It’s such a simple thing but makes the onboarding experience orders of magnitude better versus Netflix where you&amp;rsquo;re forced to type on a TV keyboard through a remote. I&amp;rsquo;m honestly surprised Netflix still hasn’t implemented this given how often the Netflix app decides to log me out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Search within Google search</title><link>/2019/12/11/search-within-google-search/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/11/search-within-google-search/</guid><description>&lt;p>Google Search has evolved quite a bit from a single search bar and now contains a ton of modules to give users what they want as quickly as they can.

Every site that sells online depends on them and yet they&amp;rsquo;re still far from what they can be. The reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve seen tend to be done when a product arrives rather than after years of use. Similarly, manufactures may change and shift production over time so early reviews will highlight the high quality of a product while latter reviews will bemoan the lack of quality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rebirth of digital piracy?</title><link>/2019/11/17/rebirth-of-digital-piracy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/11/17/rebirth-of-digital-piracy/</guid><description>&lt;p>The best jokes have an element of truth to them and earlier today I came across a comic that was a great example.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how true that is. Many of us have been cable TV free for years and were content paying a monthly internet bill along with Netflix and maybe one or two additional subscriptions.

&lt;p>For a very long time I wondered why SSO was always listed as a premium feature across nearly every enterprise software pricing page but no more! When you’re small it’s simple to manage permissions and the costs of screwing up are far smaller. Large companies, on the other hand, have complex organization structures with hundreds of employees that use a wide range of applications and access controls are a real concern. It’s possible to manage that through a herculean manual effort but it’s so much easier to just pay someone to solve the problem for you. Along similar lines, it&amp;rsquo;s valuable to minimize the amount of SAAS services used across the organization to reduce both the complexity and the cost although these days it feels like a fool&amp;rsquo;s errand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Where's the new iPhone SE?</title><link>/2019/09/12/wheres-the-new-iphone-se/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/09/12/wheres-the-new-iphone-se/</guid><description>&lt;p>After the new iPhone announcement there&amp;rsquo;s been a bunch of commentary around the desire to come up with a new version of the SE, a smaller factor phone.

Perversely, this makes sense. If economy is only slightly worse than business then I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to save quite a bit of money by choosing economy for a worse experience. Yet if the economy seats were significantly worse then I&amp;rsquo;d pay a premium for business. The art is in figuring out what that threshold should be to fill every seat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A more efficient Google Calendar</title><link>/2019/07/21/a-more-efficient-google-calendar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/21/a-more-efficient-google-calendar/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/new-gcal-event-creation.png" alt="New Google Calendar event creation" data-width="451" data-height="394" data-layout="responsive" />

One of the most recent improvements is the ability to create a fully featured event directly from the calendar screen.

Confluence has the concept of a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-time-and-date-formats-150144.html">date lozenge&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; which allows you to add a date via a helpful calendar and gives it a nice looking format.

For those not familiar (like me before today!), Substack is a startup that makes it easier for individual content creators to create and monetize newsletters with the goal of empowering them to build their own media empires.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I read the article I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think about the struggles Medium has had since its founding. It started as a blogging platform and had a variety of challenges with monetization over the years. At one point they had advertising but &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/media/medium-gives-ad-sales-calling-system-broken/">gave up&lt;/a> on it in 2017. Since then they&amp;rsquo;ve shifted to a subscription model where once you hit a limit some articles end up being put up behind a paywall, very similar to a traditional publisher.

The argument is that the market is efficient and if there was a way to drop them one of the credit card providers would have to gain an advantage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t buy this argument. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the history of merchant fees but my suspicion is that they changed minimally, if at all, over the past few decades despite the massive amount of data being collected and the processing capability to go with it. The rates could be much lower but there&amp;rsquo;s limited incentive to get there since credit card companies can charge on both the consumer and merchant side. There&amp;rsquo;s a big incentive to optimize on the consumer side since they&amp;rsquo;re the ones spending the money and understanding the default and fraud risk are major drivers of profitability. On the merchant side it&amp;rsquo;s a stable rate with little reason to change it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Combine registration and sign in</title><link>/2019/07/02/combine-registration-and-sign-in/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/02/combine-registration-and-sign-in/</guid><description>&lt;p>The goal of nearly every site or app is to get users to engage as quickly as possible.

There&amp;rsquo;s no good reason that these two flows shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be combined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A part of nearly every registration is entering an email and password so why not make them the first step of the sign up process? If that email and password are already in the system just log her in. And if not then you have the email address of a to-be-registered user. The only real risk is if someone thought they had an account and wanted to sign in but instead signed up - and that&amp;rsquo;s a good problem to have from the application side since you have the contact info of an interested user.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sign In with Apple</title><link>/2019/07/01/sign-in-with-apple/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/01/sign-in-with-apple/</guid><description>&lt;p>Apple recently made the announcement that apps that provide third party login will also be required to offer a Sign in with Apple option.

The idea is that just like getting a free puppy, you get it for free but it comes with a significant long term cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the phrase and it highlights a very common tradeoff we make, especially in engineering. We often get carried away solving a problem but fail to consider the long term cost of maintenance and support. By the time we discover these long term costs the product is entrenched and we&amp;rsquo;re on the hook for maintaining it in its current form. It&amp;rsquo;s important to slow down and realize that nearly all software we write is in the &amp;ldquo;free as in puppy&amp;rdquo; camp. Writing the code to work is the easy part - writing it to work with no ongoing cost is the challenge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Airbnb and HotelTonight</title><link>/2019/03/17/airbnb-and-hoteltonight/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/03/17/airbnb-and-hoteltonight/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few weeks ago Airbnb &lt;a href="https://press.airbnb.com/airbnb-signs-agreement-to-acquire-hoteltonight/">announced&lt;/a> that they would be acquiring Hotel Tonight.

I understand that Airbnb is trying to grow before their inevitable IPO and to do so they need to invest in growth.

It seems obvious that a company should not be autoplaying violence and I’m surprised that Netflix, a company that takes pride in its recommendation system, managed to do something this tone-deaf.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A personal DSP</title><link>/2019/02/09/a-personal-dsp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/02/09/a-personal-dsp/</guid><description>&lt;p>A common refrain from people who use adblock is that they’d be willing to pay for the content if it were an option and only use adblock to avoid the tracking and slow site speed.

That way the publisher gets the equivalent amount of money as they would otherwise and the user gets to avoid ads.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finally, some price increases</title><link>/2019/02/02/finally-some-price-increases/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/02/02/finally-some-price-increases/</guid><description>&lt;p>For as long as I can remember it felt that there was this hidden rule that companies cannot raise prices or risk mass customer abandonment. Yet the past few few months we’ve seen two major companies increase prices - &lt;a href="https://www.isostech.com/blogs/atlassian/price-increase-sandwich/">Atlassian&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/2019/01/15/netflix-price-increase-2019-standard-basic-premium/">Netflix&lt;/a> - without any adverse effects. The products are improving and are offering more functionality so it’s only fair that the prices increase. This is a welcome sign and I hope it leads to companies starting to invest significantly more in improving their existing products with the expectation that they’ll be able to raise prices in line with the additional value they’re bringing. Imagine what sort of investments companies would be making if they knew they’d be able to raise the price of their products.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Buying Kindle books on iOS</title><link>/2019/01/12/buying-kindle-books-on-ios/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/01/12/buying-kindle-books-on-ios/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this week I finished an ebook on the train and wanted to purchase another one for the way back while waiting in the station. Remarkably, Apple, a company that emphasizes and takes pride in its user experience, does not make this easy. It turns out that the Kindle app on iOS does not allow you to actually purchase a book and isn’t even allowed to link to a page where it can be purchased. I understand the business rationale - Apple wants the 30% of the digital sale and Amazon doesn’t want to give it up - but it leads to an awful experience, especially when only the station has service and I know I will be signalless once I board the train.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GitHub's new plan</title><link>/2019/01/08/githubs-new-plan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/01/08/githubs-new-plan/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier today GitHub announced that they would make a significant change to their plans: a free plan would now be able to have private repos.

&lt;p>One of the most exciting business battles is Amazon vs Walmart and I’m interested in seeing what happens in 2019. As I’m writing this Amazon has a market cap of $723B while Walmart is at $268. At the same time, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266282/annual-net-revenue-of-amazoncom/">2017 revenue&lt;/a> was $178B while Walmart’s &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/555334/total-revenue-of-walmart-worldwide/">was&lt;/a> $486B. The market views them as two completely different businesses and that’s fair - Walmart is a traditional retailer while Amazon has its hands in a variety of businesses - ranging from retail, to a marketplace, to a cloud hosting provider. Walmart is still trying to figure out ecommerce: they acquired Jet.com in 2016 and this past year bought Flipkart. Amazon, on the other hand, seems to be playing a very different game. They acquired Whole Foods in 2017 and Ring the past year. In the first case Amazon is going deeper into traditional retail while the latter feels like an entry into the home. It looks as if Walmart is fighting yesterday’s battle while Amazon continues plowing ahead into the future. I don’t know how this will play out but I am an Amazon shareholder so can’t help but feel optimistic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twenty seconds makes all the difference</title><link>/2018/12/30/twenty-seconds-makes-all-the-difference/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/30/twenty-seconds-makes-all-the-difference/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently switched from a 2015 Macbook Pro to a new ThinkPad with Ubuntu and one of the most noticeable differences is how much faster this blog builds.

I don’t want to go into the details of AMP but in order to get the performance wins all styling is inlined - that means that instead of linking to a CSS file the CSS rules are explicitly defined on each page. That means the build system is not simply generating an HTML page off of a template but also inlining the CSS rules onto every generated page.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wired headphones</title><link>/2018/12/29/wired-headphones/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/29/wired-headphones/</guid><description>&lt;p>I left my Bluetooth headphones at home this morning and ended up borrowing a wired pair during the day. I forgot how easy it is to just be able to plug in and go - no waiting for the headphones to turn on, no waiting for the Bluetooth to connect, and no having to deal with selecting the proper audio out channel. The convenience of Bluetooth outweighs the costs but it was a stark reminder of how much more robust and simpler tools used to be. To be indistinguishable from “magic” our products need to have a lot of magic inside them. Almost always the magic works but every once in a while we end up stuck. It seems to be the natural way of things. When cars were first created they were extremely mechanical and owners had the skillset and ability to fix them. Now they’re all digital and require a licensed mechanic. Computers are the same way - I grew up being able to do some quick repairs and replacements but good luck trying to replace components in modern computers or phones: it’s doable but not very enjoyable. There is a part of me that yearns for the simpler days but I’m realistic enough to know that I don’t really want to go back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Calendly</title><link>/2018/12/28/calendly/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/28/calendly/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the years I’ve received a ton of &lt;a href="https://calendly.com">Calendly&lt;/a> links - it’s an application that integrates with your calendar and hosts a personal page that allows others to book time on your calendar. As a user it’s great since it offloads scheduling responsibility from you to others. At the same time, I was was always bothered by the fact that that effort was externalized to me despite it actually being more efficient for both sides. In any case, I had a real need to actually use it in order to help an external recruiter find time on my calendar to conduct some phone screens and the onboarding process was extremely slick. It was as simple as authenticating with my Google account, granting a few permissions, and then receiving a public link that could be shared with others. I wish more products had as simple of an onboarding - you get the basic functionality with minimal effort yet have the option to customize it as you become comfortable with the product and your use case expands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy holidays from Visual Studio Code</title><link>/2018/12/25/happy-holidays-from-visual-studio-code/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/25/happy-holidays-from-visual-studio-code/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/vs-code-santa-settings.png" alt="Visual Studio Code Santa settings" data-width="130" data-height="144" data-layout="responsive" />

This is shocking. I can’t separate Internet Explorer from Microsoft. In fact, Microsoft built, launched, and bundled Internet Explorer to drive Netscape into the ground which led to the famous Microsoft &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.">antitrust case&lt;/a>. It feels as if Microsoft is giving up on Internet Explorer and it’s incredibly surprising. This is bigger than any of the other moves Microsoft has done to show they are a very different company. This is more significant than the GitHub acquisition. This is more significant than supporting their applications on operating systems other than windows. This is moving away from 20 years of history and it shows how different the current Microsoft is from the one of the past. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when this decision was discussed - there must have been so much passion in that room. There must have been so many viewpoints: ranging from those that have been working on IE for the past 20 years, to the product team that&amp;rsquo;s responsible for the future of IE, to the executive team that needed to make the call. It really is surprising that they had the strength and conviction to be able to acknowledge that they&amp;rsquo;d be better off using Chromium.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I finally tried an electric scooter</title><link>/2018/12/18/i-finally-tried-an-electric-scooter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/18/i-finally-tried-an-electric-scooter/</guid><description>&lt;p>I live in the NYC area which has Citi Bike but doesn’t allow any scooter companies to operate. In fact it actually disallows any electric bikes/scooters/skateboards/hoverboards and only makes an exception for pedal-assisted bikes. And since I haven’t been traveling much the closest I could get to trying an electric scooter was reading the endless series of articles about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily for me I went on a vacation to Mexico City and got the chance to try a Lime scooter. It was great. I use Citi Bike whenever I can in NYC so I didn’t expect the scooters to be that much different but it felt much more liberating with significantly less friction. The big difference is that there is no docking station which is always a concern in NYC: a station may be empty when I’m looking for a bike or a station is full and I need to dock a bike. The electric powered also makes it much easier to just hop on and go. I don’t mind the Citi Bike pedaling but the scooter only needed a small kick-start and then quickly accelerated to over 14 mph. The scooter was also much smaller and lighter than a Citi Bike which added to the feeling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scenepeek</title><link>/2018/12/12/scenepeek/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/12/scenepeek/</guid><description>&lt;p>Way back when as I was just leaving the finance world to go into tech I attempted a startup with a friend called Scenepeek.

There are a variety of different approaches and forms out there and each company ends up with a style that works for them. One of the core beliefs I’ve developed is that stories should be kept light and that time and effort should be spent on the product requirement documents and specs. Investing in the PRDs and specs encourages everyone to understand the high level problem being solved and how the various pieces of the solutions fit together. Otherwise you run the risk of mistaking the forest for the trees where each ticket is done as written but when combined they don’t actually work to make the proper whole.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A delivery aggregation service</title><link>/2018/11/29/a-delivery-aggregation-service/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/29/a-delivery-aggregation-service/</guid><description>&lt;p>Full disclosure: I know very little about the food delivery space so this is more speculative than anything rooted in reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given how many companies are doing food delivery it seems there should be a single delivery aggregation service that combines all of them to act as the perfect dispatcher for drivers. If I’m delivering food on behalf of Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub, and the countless others I missed it would make sense for me to be able to pick up from as many nearby restaurants as possible and then deliver to as many colocated locations as possible. The ideal situation would be that I’m able to pick up all my deliveries from a single restaurant and then deliver them all to the same floor of an apartment building.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An ad on the Google search homepage</title><link>/2018/11/26/an-ad-on-the-google-search-homepage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/26/an-ad-on-the-google-search-homepage/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/google-search-store-ad.png" alt="Google Search Homepage Store Ad" data-width="2266" data-height="1209" data-layout="responsive" />
&lt;p>Turns out not even Google is immune from the pressures of Cyber Monday. As minimal as the Google search homepage is they still made the effort to have a callout, however slight, to promote their Cyber Monday deals. A while back I read an article that calculated how much additional revenue Google would be able to generate if they put ads on their homepage. I don’t recall the exact number or the details but I imagine it’s a massive amount. Yet Google never took the step of putting ads on the search homepage so it’s interesting to see them doing it for their own store. The revenue here must be significantly less than what they’d see through traditional advertising but at the same time it’s a very minimal hit to the user experience.

One of the biggest is defining the functionality and how it should be exposed to the users. In my mind, answers to this question like on a spectrum. On one extreme you have the “take what you can get” approach where the functionality is exposed with no customization and no advanced features but the experience is optimized for one specific use case. As an example of this think of the original Google search - a single search field, minimal search functionality, and two buttons. On the other extreme you have the “customize everything” approach where you think of all possible use cases and provide options to allow users to do what they want. An example of this is Microsoft Word - most people use a fraction of all the functionality yet there’s a ton hidden away behind some menu.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What messaging war?</title><link>/2018/11/14/what-messaging-war/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/14/what-messaging-war/</guid><description>&lt;p>Apparently there’s a “messaging war” going on among the dozens of apps and social networks, all competing to be the dominant messaging app. There really are a ton of these.

What surprised me with the Google Slides experience is that I didn’t just see the existing color but also saw the previously picked color. Since I was modifying a series of objects to the same color this was a pleasant experience, especially since I was working off of a series of color shades that looked too similar.

&lt;p>This is obvious and we see it everywhere: buying in bulk gets you a discount. As a consumer I can go to Amazon and look at any item and the per unit price when buying a single item is going to be higher than when buying a pack. And the more I buy the more the discount on a per unit basis.

In fact, I don’t think it’s possible to build a loved productivity application without keyboard shortcuts. Productivity applications are all about productivity and keyboard shortcuts are what give your users power and speed.

&lt;p>The ultimate example of this is Excel. If you watch any power user of Excel they rarely, if ever, use the mouse. Instead, they’re able to do everything they need using the keyboard and significantly quicker than if they were force the mouse.

&lt;p>The one service that I wish existed, and I’m sure it does somewhere, is a place where I can send some existing clothes that I know fit me perfectly and then have them used as the basis for new, custom made clothes. I have a great dress shirt that I’ve had for many years and it shows - there’s a giant rip on the elbow and the colors are starting to fade yet I love the fit. I refuse to throw it out and instead keep rolling up the sleeves to hide the tear. If I could get the same shirt in a variety of styles and colors but with the same perfect fit I’d be glad to throw it out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>More intelligent credit card merchant rates</title><link>/2017/12/14/more-intelligent-credit-card-merchant-rates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/12/14/more-intelligent-credit-card-merchant-rates/</guid><description>&lt;p>While reading today’s &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/patreon-reverses-itself-the-patreon-backstory-and-the-reality-of-fees-patreons-mistake/">Stratechery update&lt;/a> on Patreon changing their pricing model I came across the following passage:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Of course this wasn’t great for creators: payments made for a creation released on November 2 wouldn’t land in creators’ bank accounts until some time after December 1; the reasoning, though, was clear — credit card fees. Here I can certainly bring personal experience to bear: credit card fees are really expensive (they are by far Stratechery’s largest expense)! While the exact amount varies by network (that is, American Express is the most expensive), most credit card fees are ~$0.30/charge plus anywhere from 1.5% to 3.5% of the total amount charged.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ride sharing ride bailing</title><link>/2017/11/20/ride-sharing-ride-bailing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/11/20/ride-sharing-ride-bailing/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the more frustrating modern, first-world problems is booking a Lyft or an Uber ride and having the driver cancel the ride a soon as they find out where you’re going.

I hadn’t thought much about the space but it’s a great idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fresh food is a difficult business that benefits heavily from scale. Buying in bulk gives you significant price discounts and being able to have high throughput reduces the amount of food that spoils. One of the simplest ways to increase your scale is to increase the amount of distribution channels you have. These meal-kit delivery companies started by doing delivery to the home but there’s nothing stopping them from offering the same meal kits at grocery stores. In fact, maybe it makes sense to not even have an exclusive partnership with any single chain but try to get them into as many stores as possible. They’d have to do an accurate job modeling the demand but they’d likely be able to drop the price enough to make it attractive to customers. The biggest price reduction would come from not having to ship individual orders but instead deliver them in bulk to a single store. A more interesting version of this would be to actually allow the grocery store to contribute some of the ingredients - benefiting both.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Docs vs Confluence</title><link>/2017/08/08/google-docs-vs-confluence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/08/08/google-docs-vs-confluence/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been a happy user of Google Docs for years now and have yet to find another product that makes collaboration that easy or simple.

A few weeks ago, Google Docs, one of my most heavily used applications - in fact where I’m writing this very post - made a minor change to the “Move to” functionality that created one of these small efficiency wins. Before the change, clicking the small folder icon while in a document would show a menu with the item’s current location and a “Move this item” option. Clicking that behavior would enable move mode and would require the user to navigate to the appropriate folder and then confirming the move.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Apple's ARKit</title><link>/2017/06/22/apples-arkit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/06/22/apples-arkit/</guid><description>&lt;p>During this year’s WWDC Apple announced &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/arkit/">ARKit&lt;/a>, a development framework that simplifies the ability of incorporating augmented reality into your app. I’ve been fascinated by this for a while and took a stab at getting their code running. I’ve only dabbled in iOS development so the bulk of the effort involved getting the latest Xcode beta and then discovering to run the full example I needed to upgrade my phone to run the iOS 11 beta. After this the included ARKit example worked perfectly and left me pleasantly surprised. It worked remarkably well and highlighted how powerful ARKit can be; I&amp;rsquo;ve included some sample screenshots below. Snapchat had to invest the time and effort to develop their filters but ARKit will make that significantly easier for future developers. This is an extremely powerful move by Apple since it’s all about the apps and this gives app developers a tool unique to iOS. I have a lot to learn here but I’m excited to get deeper into the augmented reality world. I remember playing with VRML in the 90s and I consider this an extension of my childhood interests.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Engineering, product, and design</title><link>/2017/05/27/engineering-product-and-design/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/05/27/engineering-product-and-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>The best products are built when engineering, product, and designers work together.

As soon as it’s sold Amazon will pick up the item and deliver it to the buyer. I’ve used Craigslist a ton in the past and coordinating the delivery and handoff was always a frustrating experience. There doesn’t seem to be much information on how quality is measured - what happens if the time you get isn’t in the shape it was listed or just doesn’t work?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The NFL abroad</title><link>/2016/10/30/the-nfl-abroad/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/10/30/the-nfl-abroad/</guid><description>&lt;p>NFL viewership is &lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/ratings-fumble-for-nfl-surprises-networks-advertisers-1475764108">down 10%&lt;/a> this season and I understand the desire to grow the brand and the sport &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_International_Series#Long-term_deals_and_the_NFL.27s_return_to_Mexico:_2016.E2.80.93present">abroad&lt;/a>.

What’s surprising, especially given Apple&amp;rsquo;s focus on delivering the perfect user experience, is that this is still a problem. I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with the hardware behind Touch ID but even if there&amp;rsquo;s some sort of warped fingerprint it should be good enough. The fact that there are a few unsuccessful attempts with the wet thumb followed by successful attempt should be enough to develop a profile for the wet version which can be used on future attempts.

I understand that in today’s digital rights world there’s always a chance for some content to be unavailable but there’s no reason it should have been included in Twitter’s flagship product that’s supposed to attract and engage new users. The fact that it’s manually curated makes it even worse - how could this have slipped through? One explanation is that the curator was not based in the US and had access to the video. The other is that the video was available initially but was pulled later on. In both cases Twitter should have had the appropriate safeguards to identify this was happening and amend the moment. An even better approach would have been to have different versions of the moment depending on the user&amp;rsquo;s location. The current implementation just feels sloppy and I can’t stand to see it in a product I love using.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snapchat's massive potential</title><link>/2016/07/03/snapchats-massive-potential/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/07/03/snapchats-massive-potential/</guid><description>&lt;p>The more I use Snapchat the more obvious the potential.

Sure enough, investors interpreted this as good move by Amazon (up 1.51% at end of day) while hurting Netflix (down 2.79% at end of day and even more post earnings). These percentages translate into a $1.34B decrease to the Netflix valuation and a $4.49B increase in valuation for Amazon. As a shareholder of both I find this behavior interesting for its irrationality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The corporate email signup design pattern</title><link>/2016/04/13/the-corporate-email-signup-design-pattern/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/04/13/the-corporate-email-signup-design-pattern/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the latest trends I’ve noticed is B2B companies is allowing you to sign up with a company email address and automatically linking you with the rest of the organization. This is a definite no-brainer and a really simple way of getting new users setup without having to be bottlenecked by a burdensome administrative process. No one on the HR team has to enter employees into the system nor send anyone their username or account info. Instead they just provide a link to the service and have people sign up with their company email address. Once this is done they immediately have access to whatever the base employee account should have. Only later one does an admin need to grant additional permissions and privileges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ben Thompson's “laddering up” and building bigger moats</title><link>/2016/04/03/ben-thompsons-laddering-up-and-building-bigger-moats/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/04/03/ben-thompsons-laddering-up-and-building-bigger-moats/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last weekend I finished the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Everything-Store-Bezos-Amazon-ebook/dp/B00BWQW73E">The Everything Store&lt;/a>, which details the rise of Amazon from a fledgling online book retailer to its current form. One pattern that stood out for me was how Amazon was able to continuously push into new business areas due to the infrastructure that they had in place based on previous decisions and commitments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They started with books but were able to grow into other smaller products once they figured out the logistics behind shipping smaller items. Once Amazon had that in place they kept tweaking their distribution system to expand the variety of products offered while improving the speed of delivery. This allowed them to keep amassing a list of products which they used to open up their platform to third party sellers. And as Amazon improved their infrastructure they were able to open that up to these third party sellers as well. In parallel, they built AWS to provide computer services to internal Amazon teams but were able to turn it into a brand new line of business that powers the majority of new startups. And now their are rumors of Amazon building out a shipping service to bypass FedEx and UPS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Airbnb, Uber, and local laws</title><link>/2016/03/06/airbnb-uber-and-local-laws/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/06/airbnb-uber-and-local-laws/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday I read an &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/business/airbnb-pits-neighbor-against-neighbor-in-tourist-friendly-new-orleans.html">interesting piece&lt;/a> on Airbnb in New Orleans.

&lt;p>But what was interesting was the repeated claims of Airbnb and the other rental marketplaces that it’s just not scalable to follow local policies for every city and it’s up to the users to know their local regulations and follow them.

This makes sense. Startups are so risky that they won’t fail due to making a few mistakes but will fail if they get out maneuvered and out innovated. The big advantage startups have is speed and that needs be leveraged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The one caveat I’d make is that every company, big and small, should have mission critical elements that need to be maintained when pushing new features and updates. I was reminded of this last week when an unnamed corporate feedback startup sent out the private one-on-one notes people jotted down in preparation for their meeting to everyone within the company. This was a huge betrayal of trust and ruined the good will people had for the company and the product. If they weren’t able to get this basic piece right how are they expected to do the rest? Every company has these mission critical components that everyone needs to be aware of and great care must be taken to ensure they work before every deploying or change. In the adtech case it’s serving ads - if ads aren’t working then publishers aren’t making any money and losing money during each impression. For cloud productivity applications it’s critical that they don’t lose your data - downtime is annoying but at least you can switch to another task while they get back up. If you lose your data and documents you have to figure out exactly what you lost and decide whether it’s worth recreating. Everyone in the company should know what these these mission critical components are and it’s everyone’s job to make sure they’re working as expected since failure carries existential risk for the customer relationship. It’s unlikely that a single bad event will ruin things but as soon as it becomes a pattern it’s likely that that customer will be lost forever and never return due to the faulty first impression.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why are Netflix and Spotify so different?</title><link>/2015/11/22/why-are-netflix-and-spotify-so-different/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/11/22/why-are-netflix-and-spotify-so-different/</guid><description>&lt;p>The news that Adele was not going to put her new album on the streaming services got me thinking about the differences between the way music and video are consumed.

&lt;p>We like to think of ourselves as &amp;ldquo;hackers&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see the length people go to &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; our products to do what they want.

In fact, I&amp;rsquo;d argue that if people aren&amp;rsquo;t hacking around a product&amp;rsquo;s limitations it&amp;rsquo;s not a good one.

&lt;p>I’m not nearly as eloquent but I also have my gripes with Twitter that his post motivated me to write. It just feels they don’t care about the user experience. Cross device sync is still a problem - if I clear a notification on my phone why do I see it again on my computer? People are still complaining about the OS X app not being as functional as the other versions. Even on my phone the navigation feels inconsistent - sometimes I get taken out of the app and sometimes a screen is loaded inside. This causes me to hit the back button at the wrong time and randomly leave the app which resets my location. I’m a big fan of Twitter and it’s pretty much the only social network I actually use but I’m frustrated by how poor it is.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Properly handling text based two factor authentication</title><link>/2015/06/20/properly-handling-text-based-two-factor-authentication/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/06/20/properly-handling-text-based-two-factor-authentication/</guid><description>&lt;p>The purpose of two factor authentication is to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts by requiring a device other than a password to verify that it’s actually you.

It’s an extra step that adds nothing to security and introduces friction into the experience. The fact that I just entered my password into a form field should be enough to trigger the authentication flow and get me back into the app. The only reasons I can think of that it’s a way to confirm that the person actually remembers their new password or that the functionality just hasn’t been built. The former case doesn’t make sense - the fact that they forgot their password indicates they rarely use the site and will just forget it again by their next login attempt. It’s easier to just give them the immediate access and have them reset their password later. An even better approach would be to just have them enter the same password twice to make sure they match. The latter reason is just sloth - the engineering effort would be minimal and it would improve the experience and mood of the users who are already frustrated after multiple failed login attempts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing jsonify.me</title><link>/2015/01/04/introducing-jsonify.me/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/01/04/introducing-jsonify.me/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past few weeks I’ve been experimenting with Node.js and wanted to share the project I’ve been working on, &lt;a href="http://jsonify.me/" target="_blank">jsonify.me&lt;/a>.

For the $20 promotion price, it’s a great deal. My alternative was an Xbox 360 along with a Raspberry Pi running XBMC. The Xbox would be used for streaming shows on Netflix and watching older DVDs while the Raspberry Pi would let me watch various files off of a USB stick. I’ve never tried a Chromecast so don’t know how the Fire Stick compares but so far it’s been much quicker to startup and navigate than either the Xbox or the Raspberry Pi. When all you want to do is watch a quick show during dinner it’s a bit frustrating when you’re done eating by the time the Netflix app is ready to use on the Xbox.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AWS: Always shipping</title><link>/2014/11/24/aws-always-shipping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/11/24/aws-always-shipping/</guid><description>&lt;div class="thumbnail">

This results in a massive storage operation using Redis where these timelines are &lt;a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/9/8/how-twitter-uses-redis-to-scale-105tb-ram-39mm-qps-10000-ins.html" target="_blank">continuously generated and cached&lt;/a>. By moving to a model where every user can be categorized into a group that sees a particular set of tweets Twitter can drastically reduce the amount of data they need to store per user. I’m sure Twitter already has a way of categorizing users in order to support the ad product and this approach would extend it to the “stream” product. In a way it’s akin to how compression works - find repeated patterns and replace every occurrence with something shorter. Then when you want to uncompress you just reverse the process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>API first startups</title><link>/2014/09/01/api-first-startups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/09/01/api-first-startups/</guid><description>&lt;p>When building a SAAS product geared towards developers the quickest way to start is to build an API.

&lt;p>The cancel screen hides the downgrade to free option and automatically chooses a paid “recommended account” with a bright clickable “Downgrade Account” button. And then, when you actually do manage to downgrade, it’s not clear from the account settings page that you downgraded since it still displays as the premium account option. Maybe when my free month is up it will downgrade or maybe I’ll get charged - how am I supposed to know? I do see a note that says canceled and I suspect I’m in the clear but there’s no way to actually confirm other than contacting support.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon courting app developers for the Fire phone</title><link>/2014/07/10/amazon-courting-app-developers-for-the-fire-phone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/07/10/amazon-courting-app-developers-for-the-fire-phone/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m a bit late to the Amazon Fire Phone party but wanted to chime in with a perspective I haven’t seen written about.

Given that typical CPMs are &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/augustinefou/digital-advertising-benchmarks-2014-by-augustine-fou" target="_blank">less than a dollar&lt;/a> with premium publishers like Facebook and Twitter getting &lt;a href="http://www.nanigans.com/2014/02/05/q4-facebook-global-advertising-trends-biggest-quarter-ever-for-paid-facebook-advertising-in-q4-2013/" target="_blank">close to $6&lt;/a>, this is a very aggressive move by Amazon to build out their ecosystem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Google Now</title><link>/2014/07/09/on-google-now/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/07/09/on-google-now/</guid><description>&lt;p>As much as it pains me to admit it I’m really enjoying Google Now. I’m aware of how much information I&amp;rsquo;m sharing with Google to make it helpful but at the moment I find the tradeoff worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It came in especially useful as I&amp;rsquo;ve been traveling over the past couple of weeks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Show the official exchange rate when traveling. This may not be perfect, especially in the case of &amp;ldquo;blue markets,&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s nice having a rough idea of how much a US dollar is worth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Flight information. Since my flight details get sent to my Gmail account, I can quickly tell whether my flight&amp;rsquo;s delayed and what terminal and gate it&amp;rsquo;s scheduled to depart from and arrive to. This is useful to have when I need to make a transfer since I can quickly see where my next flight departs from.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Flight boarding passes. In addition to the flight information Google Now also shows the boarding passes for my checked in flights. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do anything to board a plane other than activate my home screen and place it against a scanner.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hotel information. Similar to flight information, I get a card telling me where my hotel is and how to get there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Google calendar integration. This is an obvious one but I run my life through Google calendar. This gives me constant notifications of what I have to do when and as long as I enter an address for my events I also get an estimate for when I should leave.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A concern is that to actually make it useful I have to integrate more and more of my world with Google and I expect this to get worse as more Google Now cards are developed. The optimist in me hopes that Google Now will be opened up to third party developers in a future version of Android but the cynic suspects it&amp;rsquo;s not going to happen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Fab's latest move</title><link>/2014/05/24/on-fabs-latest-move/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/05/24/on-fabs-latest-move/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fab recently &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/21/fab-lays-off-one-third-of-staff-from-new-york-city-office/" target="_blank">laid off&lt;/a> a third of their staff as they transition from designer flash sales into customized goods and their own private label. The business is tough and reminded me of our experiences building &lt;a href="http://makersalley.com" target="_blank">Makers Alley&lt;/a>. We initially set out to build a place where people can buy customized, personal furniture from local designers.

Instead of locking the user out of the account or forcing a password reset they send an email with two links - one to log in to the account directly and another to reset the password. I don’t recall ever seeing this approach before and wish more sites started doing it. This approach also obviates the need to even have a password - a site can just send a “login link” for an entered email address and the user can login via their inbox. This is similar to the way we login via the various social networks but instead of being sent to a social network for confirmation we are sent to our inbox. The only friction is having to go to your inbox to click on the link but since most people keep their inboxes open all day I don’t see this as a huge problem. The other advantage is security - most people use the same password across multiple sites so if one is compromised the others become vulnerable. Under this approach each site will have its own security controls and it becomes impossible for one site’s shoddy security to affect another’s. This is probably too drastic of a change for most users but I’d love to see sites start embracing this model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>System knowledge and human creativity</title><link>/2014/04/28/system-knowledge-and-human-creativity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/04/28/system-knowledge-and-human-creativity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I read an interesting article about &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-06/humans-replacing-robots-herald-toyota-s-vision-of-future.html" target="_blank">humans replacing robots&lt;/a> in Toyota&amp;rsquo;s factory. The thesis being that only humans are creative enough (right now at least) to develop new skills and processes to deal with production inefficiencies. This rings true - in order to improve a manufacturing system you need to understand the entire process, from the raw ingredients up to the way consumers end up using the product. It&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to do these days as products become more complicated with an increasing number of specialized components and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see companies taking a longer term view and focusing on the value of human creativity rather than short term cost cutting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Craigslist: the web's fertilizer</title><link>/2014/04/25/craigslist-the-webs-fertilizer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/04/25/craigslist-the-webs-fertilizer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Craigslist has become the fertilizer of the web. This realization came to me last week when I needed to get a replacement phone and decided to search for one on Craigslist.Filtering past the obvious scams I thought I find a legitimate offer and reached out. Within a few minutes I received the following response from &amp;ldquo;Kyle&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>Hi a guy bought this from me, but I can tell you where I got it from.
I got 3 of these from http://enetcweb.com/dibzees and I resold them for some extra money.
The trick is to watch for bidding to slow down and then put in a bid. That's what I do and I win most of the time.
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And this was from a listing that seemed legitimate! The vast majority of listings were clearly fraudulent that promised either amazing deals or was the same posting duplicated a dozen times with slightly different wording. Even beyond the fraud and scams there are probably tons of startups trying to take advantage of the network that Craigslist offers. Some are listing their products and services to validate their market and others are reaching out to owners of various listings trying to sell them on something.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Self hosted services</title><link>/2014/04/07/self-hosted-services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/04/07/self-hosted-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>It never bothered me when apps were acquired and shut down but the &lt;a href="https://readmill.com/epilogue" target="_blank">Readmill news&lt;/a> hit me hard. It was one of the truly “free” ebook readers and never got in my way. It fit my behavior perfectly - I would download my books from wherever, drag them into the Readmill web app, and have them permanently accessible on my iPad after a quick sync.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first reaction was wishing that it would be open sourced but that got me thinking about third party services. Numerous people have been saying how dangerous it is to rely on third party services but until Readmill it never really mattered to me. Sure, in the abstract it’s better to have everything hosted on your own but in reality it’s impossible to get to the same level of quality and experience for everything we use. We’re constantly balancing tradeoffs and we’re biased to favor the short term factors, such as ease of use and simplicity of set up, rather than long term ones, such as privacy, control, and data ownership.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Goodbye Gmail</title><link>/2014/03/18/goodbye-gmail/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/03/18/goodbye-gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/image/fastmail-load.png" alt="Fastmail load times" data-width="510" data-height="20" data-layout="responsive" /> &lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the course of the past year I’ve become more and more pissed off at Gmail. I loved using Gmail when it launched - it made writing and reading email a pleasure. It was simple, clean, and responsive. Now it’s the opposite. All actions feel slow. The initial page load takes a substantial amount of time and then I get to wait for the various page elements to load - including a chat list that I’m almost never signed into and integration with a slew of other Google products. Loading emails or new tabs is noticeably slow and the search is sluggish for a company whose main product is a search engine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Follow the WhatsApp money</title><link>/2014/03/06/follow-the-whatsapp-money/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/03/06/follow-the-whatsapp-money/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this week I received the following email from imo.im:&lt;/p>

For years imo.im has supported third party chat clients but within a couple of weeks of the WhatsApp acquisition they’ve abandoned that support to focus on their own network and become the next WhatsApp. For a while now they’ve been building features to support this move - videos in August, stickers in January - and I wonder what would have happened if they focused on their platform earlier. Now they’re just playing catch up to WhatsApp, Kik, Line, and countless others. Timing is critical and I suspect it’s too late for imo.im to be entering the first party messaging fray.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Foursquare as a contact book</title><link>/2014/02/13/foursquare-as-a-contact-book/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/02/13/foursquare-as-a-contact-book/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few days ago I discovered a new use case for Foursquare when I was meeting up with a friend.

They’re both simple, clean products that allow writers to concentrate on their writing rather than configuring the dozens of options available in other blogging platforms. They’ve also done a great job with the typography that makes the content enjoyable to read.

I used RunKeeper to record my runs and used its goal feature to track my progress and quickly see how much I had left. Two days before the new year, I was able to hit my goal and got a little notification from RunKeeper congratulating me on achieving my goal. This small notification got me thinking about how emotion is built into our products. RunKeeper doesn’t care whether it was a 1 mile or 1000 mile goal - the reaction I get would be the same. Yet if I shared these two achievements with my friends, the reactions I get would be completely different. Sure, an algorithm could be designed to treat accomplishments of various difficulties differently and can even be adapted to take into account that to some people, running one mile is equivalent to others running 1000 miles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ebook readers</title><link>/2014/01/15/ebook-readers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/01/15/ebook-readers/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m an avid reader and have embraced the move to digital.

&lt;p>On my iPad, I have iBooks, Readmill, Oyster, Kindle, and ShuBook with each having a separate use case. iBooks and the Kindle app are for books that I purchased from iTunes and Amazon, respectively. Oyster is a great ebook subscription service but I’m limited to the books available in their library. I discovered ShuBook when I wanted to host my own ebook server but have switched to Readmill due to the much nicer reading experience, a web interface to manage my library, and cross-device syncing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Surge pricing ideas</title><link>/2014/01/05/surge-pricing-ideas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/01/05/surge-pricing-ideas/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every time there’s a big event or terrible weather, there’s a slew of complaints about Uber’s surge pricing.

It’s surprisingly difficult to find tech products that fit this description. Cell phones will almost always work internationally but roaming charges make it impractical. Having an unlocked phone helps but you still need to get a SIM card which is a &lt;a href="http://dangoldin.com/2013/12/23/getting-a-sim-card-in-india/">hassle&lt;/a> in many countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even something as standard as a laptop isn’t as easy to use as it should be. Wifi connectivity varies depending where you are with most cities being great fickle elsewhere.

Instead of building a UX designed to handle bulk operations and complicated workflows you build support for file uploads and handle the business logic entirely on the backend. The motivation is that it’s extremely difficult to build a UI that’s going to be as powerful and flexible as a simple CSV file, especially when outside tools, such as Excel, can help generate these files.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why are there so many cleaning startups?</title><link>/2013/12/09/why-are-there-so-many-cleaning-startups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/12/09/why-are-there-so-many-cleaning-startups/</guid><description>&lt;p>The recent rise of marketplace startups is great and benefits all except the incumbent. They provide much needed liquidity and transparency to markets that helpfully reduce costs to the consumer and increase volume to the provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet I’m surprised by the number of home cleaning service startups out there. I’m aware of &lt;a href="https://www.homejoy.com/" target="_blank">HomeJoy&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://iamexec.com/" target="_blank">Exec&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://getmaid.com/" target="_blank">GetMaid&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.myclean.com/" target="_blank">MyClean&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://www.handybook.com/" target="_blank">HandyBook&lt;/a>, but am sure there are countless other copycats. The Uber approach works because it’s for an immediate service with a one time transaction where the value provided is somewhat of a commodity. This is not the case with home cleaning services. The range of quality among cleaners varies significantly more than the quality among drivers and I’d be willing to have a good cleaner come in at a slightly inconvenient time rather than a poor cleaner at the perfect time. And once I find a cleaner I like I’d want to book them directly rather than go through the company again. This way I can get a lower rate while also giving a cleaner more than they’d otherwise make from using the service. This would violate the company’s terms but I don’t see how they can be enforced.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Twitter flashback</title><link>/2013/11/16/a-twitter-flashback/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/11/16/a-twitter-flashback/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/twitter-ecosystem.png" alt="The Twitter ecosystem" data-width="624" data-height="379" data-layout="responsive" />

&lt;p>The blog post described the changes Twitter planned on making with the intent of taking control of the developer ecosystem.

I’m impressed by the number of customers MongoHQ was able to sign up - they spanned the gamut from sites that I don’t even recall signing up for to startups that have been getting significant buzz.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a database as a service company is able to get hacked it doesn’t leave me optimistic about the way other companies are securing our data. As much as these “as a service” products make our lives easier they bring an increased risk to our business and more importantly our customers. Sure their security will be better than someone who’s setting up a MongoDB instance for the first time but that has to be balanced against the fact that a hosting site offers a much higher reward for a hacking attempt. Access to the infrastructure provides a lot more information than hacking an individual site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What the SEO?

The news that the 5C’s starting price was $549 left many in the tech community &lt;a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/09/reactions.html" target="_blank">surprised and concerned&lt;/a> with many believing that the price needed to be lower than $400 in order to compete worldwide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm definitely speculating but I believe the reason for such a high price for the 5C was to avoid cannibalizing the sales of the 5S while also framing the comparison to be iPhone vs iPhone instead of iPhone vs Android. When people go smartphone shopping they see that the 5S is “only” $100 more than the 5C and pay the difference for the more premium product. If the 5C were significantly cheaper people would be comparing it to a similarly priced Android phone which may encourage them to go with the Android or they'd compare it against the 5S which would get many to purchase the much cheaper 5C instead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Going rate for an email address</title><link>/2013/09/30/going-rate-for-an-email-address/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/09/30/going-rate-for-an-email-address/</guid><description>&lt;div class="row">

A couple of months ago I started noticing popups on various ecommerce sites offering a first purchase discounts in exchange for entering an email address. Every time I noticed this happening I took a screenshot to track the offer and compile a list of the retailers using this approach. I’m still collecting examples and would more of them but so far the going rate seems to be anywhere from 10 to 25% off the first order. The pitch is pretty compelling and I think most people would gladly give up their email for the possibility of a discount. I’d also love to know what impact the magnitude of the discount has on the sign up rates; I suspect it’s minimal but definitely better than gaining entry to a sweepstakes or a lottery.

I’ll sit down with the client to understand the scope of the project and work with them to break it down into smaller, more manageable components. Based on this break down, I’ll estimate the time required for each piece and come up with an estimated total time. I charge my usual hourly rate for the work that falls within the estimated time but will charge a steeply discounted rate for every hour that goes over.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Startups aren't black and white</title><link>/2013/09/02/startups-arent-black-and-white/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/09/02/startups-arent-black-and-white/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I was making the leap into the startup world I read every post I came across that talked about people’s experiences and guides in running a startup.

Now that I’ve been working on a startup for almost two years I realize how much startups differ from one another and how black and white these guides tend to be. You can read two posts that will promote contradictory approaches. Should you focus on revenue or growth? Should you raise money or bootstrap? Should you go with a freemium model or paid only? Should you go solo or get a cofounder?

&lt;a href="http://netflix.com/" target="_blank">Netflix&lt;/a> recently reintroduced &lt;a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2013/08/make-netflix-your-own-with-profiles.html" target="_blank">profiles&lt;/a> so now each household member can get their own recommendations, recently watched items, and instant queue rather than being forced to share the same polluted profile. This is an awesome win for Netflix customers but it’s been bugging me that they didn’t do this sooner; it’s such an obvious feature that it should have been built as soon as Netflix realized that multiple family members would be sharing their account.

The fact that someone ended up on a 404 page is a sign that something is broken but instead of trying to fix the problem they try to distract their visitors by making them laugh. It’s equivalent to getting to a restaurant and seeing an amazing menu only to discover that it’s closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can’t always control which URLs our visitors will type in or click on but we can control what they see when they get there. Instead of trying to distract them with humor why not offer suggestions for what they may have wanted to see? The majority of 404 visits are the result of typos which could be fixed with a simple spell check and the remainder are due to moved pages which can be solved by notifying the linker or providing a redirect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The power inbox</title><link>/2013/07/27/the-power-inbox/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/07/27/the-power-inbox/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are only a few tabs I consistently keep open all day on my computer - Gmail, Google Calendar, Hacker News, and New Relic.

For this post, I’m not interested in the content (which is great for anyone building a company) but I am interested in the concept of business frameworks and their application. When I was younger and came across a “business” framework I would dismiss it as obvious and move on. Now, I’m aware of how valuable a good framework can be. A good framework imposes structure that leads to a clearer though process with better results. At the same time, it needs to be simple to apply but be expressive enough to describe the complexity of a business. Being human, we also don’t want to think about our own fallibility and weaknesses which makes it difficult to critique our businesses. We also want to solve problems on our own rather than share our uncertainties with others. A framework serves as an impartial third party where you go through and fill in the blanks until you discover you aren’t in as good of a shape as you thought. Now you can work on growing your company instead of avoiding self-criticism.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Netflix, bundling, and the future of video</title><link>/2013/05/05/netflix-bundling-and-the-future-of-video/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/05/05/netflix-bundling-and-the-future-of-video/</guid><description>&lt;p>Something that’s been stuck in my head is the relationship between Netflix and bundling.

The idea is to engage the new user by showing them that there’s a real person behind the service that cares and to offer any help that they may need. There’s a great &lt;a href="https://segment.io/academy/email-is-the-easiest-way-to-improve-retention" target="_blank">article&lt;/a> on Segment.io about this tactic as well as a few other emails that can be sent to improve retention.

Tech pundits have been saying that for a while now but experiencing it firsthand is definitely more convincing.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul class="bulleted">
 &lt;li>I went for a run with only my phone to keep me company. After my run was done, I wanted to grab a cup of iced coffee and realized that Starbucks gave me a free drink on my birthday. Downloading the app on my phone allowed me to get a drink without having cash or a wallet.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>While checking out at a grocery store, a friend showed me CardStar which allowed him to store all his loyalty cards on his phone. Since then, I’ve imported all my loyalty cards that have just been sitting in a drawer into my phone.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>After getting a Raspberry Pi and installing Raspbmc, I was able to use my phone as a remote control just by downloading an app.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These behaviors are different and yet they’re all converging on the phone. What they have in common is that &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html" target="_blank">software is replacing hardware&lt;/a>. Hardware doesn’t need to become smarter, it just needs to be able to sync with our phones which can do the heavy lifting. The functionality then becomes limited by software which can be updated more cheaply and quickly than the hardware. It also solves the problem of hardware companies trying to develop software that results in a terrible user experience. Do cars really need the ability to &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/01/07/ford.twitter/index.html" target="_blank">read a Twitter&lt;/a> feed? And if they do, why not just do it via a simple Bluetooth connection and an audio streaming app on a phone?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coke, Pepsi and Passover</title><link>/2013/04/05/coke-pepsi-and-passover/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/04/05/coke-pepsi-and-passover/</guid><description>&lt;div class="right10">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>During Passover, Coke and Pepsi sell sugar based versions of their sodas in order to stay kosher for Passover. These high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) free sodas are extremely popular and people stock up while they can. I don’t know whether this is due to the better taste, the nostalgia, or the limited supply but these sugar based versions are definitely more popular. I wonder what would happen if either Coke or Pepsi decided to go “all in” on sugar and launch a marketing campaign against HFCS based food and drinks. I’d love to look at the margins of sugar vs HFCS based sodas and see what the market share increase would need to be in order to offset the switch to sugar. My gut tells me that pursuing this strategy would be a win but the companies are too entrenched in their current process that it’s just not going to happen. Smaller soda manufacturers, such as Boylan, GuS, and Moxie, are growing by differentiating themselves from the big guys and are emphasizing the healthier ingredients. I’m hopeful that this will pressure Coke and Pepsi to make their soda healthier. Unfortunately, what’s more likely to happen is that they will just acquire the niche manufacturers position them to appeal to the more concious consumer, similar to what’s happening to &lt;a href="http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/the-big-brewers-brands/" target="_blank">craft breweries&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mailbox: Is the server required?</title><link>/2013/03/29/mailbox-is-the-server-required/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/03/29/mailbox-is-the-server-required/</guid><description>&lt;div class="right10">

My first distinct memory of seeing it is from &lt;a href="https://yourkarma.com/" target="_blank">Karma&lt;/a> but I’ve started noticing it everywhere. It runs the gamut from non-profit &lt;a href="http://www.weheartwifi.com/" target="_blank">causes&lt;/a> to video game &lt;a href="http://www.sandboxstrat.com/" target="_blank">PR firms&lt;/a>. In fact, we’re even using this approach for the Makers Alley &lt;a href="https://makersalley.com/" target="_blank">homepage&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Surprisingly, it’s starting to make inroads on news sites as well. Whereas before news sites would have an article spread across 20 pages (looking at you Business Insider) in order to increase page views and show more ads, some news outlets are actually improving the user experience. Both &lt;a href="http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/" target="_blank">NPR&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/sports/wp/2013/02/27/cyclings-road-forward/" target="_blank">Washington Post&lt;/a> have posted pieces that leverage this approach and it creates a significantly more engaging read.

Let’s start with a joke:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 An American consultant was at a pier in a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The Mexican replied "Only a little while." The consultant then asked why didn't he stay out longer and catch more fish? The fisherman said he had enough to support his family's immediate needs. Then the American asked how he spent the rest of his time.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The Mexican fisherman said, "I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Maria, and then stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, senor."&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The American consultant scoffed, "I am a very successful business consultant and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and, with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, and eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York City where you will run your expanding enterprise."&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The Mexican fisherman asked, "But senor, how long will this all take?"&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The consultant replied, "Probably 15 to 20 years."&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 "But what then, senor?" asked the fisherman.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The consultant laughed, and said, "That's the best part! When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public. You'll become very rich, you would make millions!"&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 "Millions, senor?" replied the Mexican. "Then what?"&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 The American said, "Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos."
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Other than the chuckle, this joke got me thinking about how people view work. The joke suggests that you should only work to support your life outside of work. If you work more than that then the joke’s on you since you’re sacrificing your personal life. This is view that you can’t have if you’re starting a company. Entrepreneurs need to combine their personal and professional lives. If you’re running a startup and aren’t thinking about the market, your product, or your users when you’re in the shower or in bed you’re doing it wrong. More importantly, this should be natural and not forced. If you don’t enjoy thinking about your startup when times are good, how will you be able to do it when times are tough (which they will be)? We need our passion to get over the humps so if you’re not passionate about your startup when you’re starting out, you will abandon it when facing challenges. Your startup will end up consuming you so why not pick something that you care about?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eating Yourself - Innovation &amp;amp; Cannibalization</title><link>/2012/08/12/eating-yourself-innovation-amp-cannibalization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/08/12/eating-yourself-innovation-amp-cannibalization/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/snakeself.jpg" alt="traffic efficiency" data-width="550" data-height="370" data-layout="responsive" />
&lt;p>I was rereading the HBR paper on &lt;a href="http://hbr.org/2006/10/strategies-for-two-sided-markets/ar/1" target="_blank">Strategies for Two Sided Markets&lt;/a> and came across a passage describing Apple’s mistake of trying to monetize both sides of their market, the consumers and the developers, rather than focusing on one like Microsoft did by giving away the SDK for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It got me thinking about Apple’s recovery. Many people credit the iPod with revitalizing Apple but I think there’s more than that. I suspect the bigger reason was the decline of desktop software and the ability to be productive on the web. Suddenly the network effects that existed by having software that only worked on Windows no longer existed. Software started migrating to the web and people were more willing to try new operating systems out. In 2006, I switched to Linux without too much trouble. It was also simple to find help online to deal with the various issues I ran into which made the transition easier. In some ways, Google helped Apple recover by speeding up the move to the web with a more accurate search and a good set of productivity apps.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In Defense of Yahoo</title><link>/2012/08/05/in-defense-of-yahoo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/08/05/in-defense-of-yahoo/</guid><description>&lt;img alt="Yahoo logo" src="/image/yahoo-logo.png" />
&lt;p>Reading recent tech coverage makes you think that each newly startup is more valuable than Yahoo. Yahoo is the 4th most visited site in the world with over 300 million users on Yahoo mail. This is a problem every startup should hope to have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>User acquisition is the most difficult task for a consumer startup. User attrition is an easier problem to solve than user acquisition. Yahoo doesn’t need to build a product that’s 10 times better than the competition, they just need to simplify and improve what they already have. Yahoo also has massive usage among the mass market with millions of people having Yahoo as their home page. These are not the same people that sign up for every startup featured on TechCrunch. Yahoo has challenges but worrying about user acquisition is not one of them. Yahoo will need to develop a vision and relentlessly pursue it. The culture will need to change and vested interests will need to be broken.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Startup Advantage - Details, Details, Details</title><link>/2012/07/28/the-startup-advantage-details-details-details/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/07/28/the-startup-advantage-details-details-details/</guid><description>&lt;div>&lt;img src="https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7vxx4vhKa1qz9esq.png"/>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A frustration I’ve been experiencing more and more is having to reload a webpage in order to change the date range in the options. If a company expects me to keep a site open for more than a day they should make it easy for me to update the options. The big example is Google Analytics - I open up a page, choose a date range, and get to see my charts. If I keep the tab open and want to want to run the same analysis the next day, I’m forced to reload the page to even be able to include today in the date range. It’s an unnecessary action for the user and it would be easy to correct this behavior with some simple Javascript.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Race to 0 - RIM vs IE</title><link>/2012/07/10/race-to-0-rim-vs-ie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/07/10/race-to-0-rim-vs-ie/</guid><description>&lt;p>I read an &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-09/rim-s-customers-working-on-contingency-plans-corporate-canada.html" target="_blank">article&lt;/a> earlier today about how companies are preparing for a possible demise of RIM and couldn’t help but compare RIM’s decline over only a few years compared to how long it’s taking IE to disappear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To confirm that there is in fact a difference in behavior, we can compare the RIM share among smartphones and IE share among browsers. Turns out that they are noticeably different: IE is on a linear decline with close to 70% in Q3 2008 but around 36% in Q1 2012 while RIM starts at 16% in Q3 2008, goes up to a high of 21% in 2009 and then drops to 7% in Q1 2012. Plotting their % decline since the data starting point highlights this further. If we calculate the average decline per quarter from their highest levels and try to see how long it will take to hit 0% share, IE will take almost 4 years while RIM will take less than 5 quarters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Achieving browser autocomplete</title><link>/2012/06/07/achieving-browser-autocomplete/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/06/07/achieving-browser-autocomplete/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/autocomplete.png" alt="Screenshot of date range tool in action" data-width="500" data-height="89" data-layout="responsive" />
&lt;p>Over the past few days, I’ve been thinking about habits. How do they form? How do they change? And the selfish one - how can you build a product that is habit forming? My cofunder sent me a great Nir &amp;amp; Far &lt;a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/how-to-manufacture-desire.html">blog post&lt;/a> that goes into detail about generating desire which is a great read to anyone building a consumer product.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Selling to the enterprise?

The typical approach is to offer a free trials or have some sort of freemium product. Each sign up is then treated as an inbound lead that is assigned an account manager. Within two weeks of signing up for New Relic I was contacted by an account manager who helped answer my questions and helped me get New Relic set up for Glossi. Working with him, we were able to get a longer trial period and a discounted price for when we’re ready to upgrade. &lt;a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31555/Inbound-Leads-Cost-61-Less-Than-Outbound-New-Data.aspx" target="_blank">HubSpot found&lt;/a> that inbound leads cost 61% less than outbound leads. If having a strong SEO and Social Media presence drops acquisition costs that much imagine the drop caused by having a usable product. Although we’re a small, scrappy startup that’s quick to try new products and services, I believe this approach will become the standard way of selling SAAS in the enterprise. It’s much easier to get a person to try something new and if you can turn him into a fan, you’re one step closer to getting the company signed up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Draw Something Zyngafied</title><link>/2012/04/12/draw-something-zyngafied/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/04/12/draw-something-zyngafied/</guid><description>&lt;p>We’re aware of Zynga’s purchase of Draw Something and Zynga’s emphasis on analytics and metrics to drive product features and decisions. I’m a bit late to the party but I tried brainstorming to put together  a Zyngafied version of Draw Something:&lt;strong>&lt;br/>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul class="bulleted">
 &lt;li>&lt;span>Favor drawings that require colors that a user does not have to encourage the user to buy new colors.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;span>Leverage the priming effect by picking words that will encourage users to spend more. For example using the words “gold”, “coin”, and “rich” would put users in a buying mood.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;span>Charge more for the more popular color packs.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;span>Include “limited edition” color and word packs.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;span>Reward active users with free color packs, bombs, etc.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I, for one, am glad that I got to play Draw Something before it turns into this money extraction machine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Future of Startups - Small Teams, Big Profit</title><link>/2012/04/10/future-of-startups-small-teams-big-profit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/04/10/future-of-startups-small-teams-big-profit/</guid><description>&lt;p>The big news today was that Facebook acquired Instagram for $1B in cash and stock. I don’t want to debate whether that was a good price but I am amazed that Instagram was able to get to over 30 million users with 13 employees, of which 3 are engineers. I see a few factors combining to make this an ideal model for the future tech startup.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul class="bulleted">
 &lt;li>Open source tools and the cloud have made starting easier than ever and a few motivated, talented people can build a marketable product over a weekend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social networks simplify distribution and allow a good product to stand out and succeed without heavy marketing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are comfortable with technology and can start using a product without any dedicated support.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>They are converging to provide a massive increase in leverage. A small team is able to quickly and cheaply build a product that can spread organically to millions of users. The enterprise space will also be impacted as people start expecting their personal tools in their corporate environments. It’s definitely an exciting time to be building a tech startup.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Where are the event recommendation startups?</title><link>/2012/03/30/where-are-the-event-recommendation-startups/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/03/30/where-are-the-event-recommendation-startups/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few years ago I worked on a startup with the goal of providing local event recommendations. Unfortunately, we were never able to make it work. We focused too much on building new features, didn’t simplify our product enough, didn’t have a focused vision, and didn’t spend time understanding the market. After reading Mark Hendrickson’s &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/22/post-mortem-for-plancast/" title="A Post-Mortem for Plancast" target="_blank">Plancast’s postmortem&lt;/a>, I started thinking about the problem again and what a successful approach would look like. As Mark pointed out, it’s difficult to incent people to consistently broadcast their plans. Most people will only plan major events in advance and even fewer will log into a website to note that they’re going to grab beers with a friend in a few hours. One thing people are starting to do is checking in to a venue. Knowing the present is a lot simpler than thinking about the future and smartphones have reinforced this behavior. Foursquare has been riding this wave and apps like GroupMe and Fast Society have also taken advantage.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overcoming the Build Bias</title><link>/2012/03/24/overcoming-the-build-bias/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/03/24/overcoming-the-build-bias/</guid><description>&lt;p>An issue I’ve been trying to overcome is what I like to call the “build bias.” Whenever I’d run into a technical problem, I’d want to solve it on my own - whether it’s by writing some code or by installing and configuring various libraries and packages. I remember the time I needed to collect feedback for a website but instead of just using an off the shelf product like &lt;a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/" title="GetSatisfaction" target="_blank">GetSatisfaction&lt;/a>, I decided to create my own. Although I was able to get it working, it took me longer than expected to get it into a usable state and distracted me from the other improvements I wanted to make.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>As a developer, it’s very easy to convince yourself to build from scratch every time you need something rather than using an existing solution. It’s exciting to work on something new and it’s annoying integrating someone else’s code. It’s even worse when they’re charging a few dollars a month for something that you can build in a few hours.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>More often than not we underestimate the cost of building something of sufficient quality and don’t include the ongoing maintenance cost we’ll most likely be doing. More importantly, we are no longer focusing on the highest leverage activity. As they teach in business schools, you shouldn’t outsource your core competency but everything else is fair game. This is also supported by the lean startup approach which encourages getting your product to market as soon as possible so you can validate your market hypotheses. Why spend time building features when you don’t even know you have a marketable product? If it does turn out that you have a successful product you can always go back and develop your own solution then.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>My new process is to first make sure that the feature is even needed. If it is, I check out the open source alternatives to see if anything can be used. If not, I look at the available paid solutions. For many small projects, it turns out that you can ride the trial/basic version enough to validate your idea. This approach has led &lt;a href="http://www.glos.si" title="Glossi" target="_blank">Glossi&lt;/a> to use &lt;a href="https://mongohq.com/home" title="MongoHQ" target="_blank">MongoHQ&lt;/a> to host my database, &lt;a href="http://sendgrid.com/" title="SendGrid" target="_blank">SendGrid&lt;/a> as my email system, and &lt;a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/" title="GetSatisfaction" target="_blank">GetSatisfaction&lt;/a> as a feedback widget in addition to ton of open source libraries. With every new project, I’m offloading more and more of my auxiliary features to cloud based services and feel much more productive. Makes me wonder how many other services there are out there that can be leveraged.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GroupOn Scheduler</title><link>/2011/12/08/groupon-scheduler/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2011/12/08/groupon-scheduler/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/image/groupon-scheduler.png" alt="iOS security recommendation" data-width="616" data-height="358" data-layout="responsive" />
&lt;p>I'm not surprised that someone came out with an &lt;a href="http://www.groupon.com/scheduler" title="GroupOn Scheduler">online scheduling tool&lt;/a> for SMBs. I am a bit surprised that it was GroupOn though. I suspect many smaller companies have tried doing it but found selling to the SMB much more difficult than they expected. Since GroupOn already has penetration in the SMB space they may find it a lot easier, especially if, as it looks, they will be offering it free to any business that runs a GroupOn promotion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Giving Employees Free Adwords?</title><link>/2010/08/25/google-giving-employees-free-adwords/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2010/08/25/google-giving-employees-free-adwords/</guid><description>&lt;p>According to this [http://agtb.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/my-1day-adwords-account/](blog post), Gogole gives their emplo﻿yees $1 a day to advertise on Google. The intent is to give employees the perspective of an Adwords user in order to improve the product. In addition to giving employees exposure to Adwords, this also has potential to increase the competition in Adword auctions by causing bids to increase and leading to more revenue  for Google. Given that Google has more than 10,000 employees worldwide this can have an effect on smaller advertisers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Power of Twitter</title><link>/2009/03/08/power-of-twitter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2009/03/08/power-of-twitter/</guid><description>&lt;p>I may be a bit late to the party but I was finally able to see the power of &lt;a title="Twitter" rel="homepage" href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter&lt;/a> this afternoon.&lt;/p>

Right now, I went to searched for "AIM" on Twitter and discovered that other people were having the same problem. Turns out it was a systematic problem and I wasn't the only one affected. Being able to know more about this problem is a great benefit. There has been a lot of talk of the power of real time search and real time news but this was my first real glimpse into the power of Twitter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some thoughts on innovation</title><link>/2008/10/01/some-thoughts-on-innovation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/10/01/some-thoughts-on-innovation/</guid><description>&lt;p>I stumbled unto an &lt;a href="http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2008/03/24/what-will-life-be-like-in-the-year-2008/">article&lt;/a> written in 1968 that tries to predict what the world of 2008 will be like.

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Jerry Yang was doing everything in his power to prevent MS from acquiring Yahoo - what type of message does that send and how must the employees of Yahoo feel if their CEO is acting this way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In order to compete with Google, the merger must have gotten done quickly and smoothly, this would not have been the case in the case of a hostile takeover.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There have been rumors that many of Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s employees were just waiting for the merger to happen in order to cash in on their new accelerated vesting and compensation packages, immediately leaving Yahoo there after.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A lot of the Yahoo employees and MSFT employees and investors did not want the merger to go through. From what I know the largest group that wanted the merger to go through were the Yahoo investors, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yahoo will now have to deal with a variety of problems: shareholder lawsuits, talk of Jerry&amp;rsquo;s management ability, sudden price drop. All these may in fact lead to another Microsoft offer in maybe a few months at a much lower price - in which case it will probably be accepted.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The only downside that just immediately to my mind is that MS and Yahoo are in deep water and do need to do something in order to compete with Google - but I do not think the merger would have necessarily helped them, given the merging difficulties and the corporate culture clash.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why does EA want Take Two?</title><link>/2008/04/29/why-does-ea-want-take-two/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/04/29/why-does-ea-want-take-two/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why no one is pointing this out but it seems that as soon as EA acquires T2, the T2 folks would just leave to create a new studio.

And although EA would get the rights to all of the T2 games and may try to develop the series, they might not have the imagination or the guys to do it.

He&amp;rsquo;s giving 2 reasons for the acquisition and I wanted to add to two of his points.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The short term reason is to force Intel to give Apple price cuts for fear that Apple will make their own chips: I do not think that Intel needs to worry about Apple manufacturing their own PC chips as Apple already went through that phase and AMD already provides the necessary pressure on Intel to lower their prices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the future, software and OSes will not be tied down to a specific chip so Apple will start manufacturing their own processors to increase their margins: I think the author is on to something regarding the future of processors but I do not think the PC market will change that drastically. Apple will probably start making their own chips for the iPhone and their new gadgets but I doubt they will do the same for the PC market.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Edit: Just found out that Apple already makes a server (Thanks Brian). I have to start doing some research from now on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
