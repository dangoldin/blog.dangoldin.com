For the sixth year in a row I updated my Yahoo fantasy football stats scraper to pull Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s projected fantasy stats for the upcoming season. The only change this year was the addition of a &amp;ldquo;O Rank&amp;rdquo; column which was simple to implement so I have no excuse for pushing this off till the last minute.</description></item><item><title>Instacart price markup</title><link>/2021/02/15/instacart-price-markup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 15:53:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>/2021/02/15/instacart-price-markup/</guid><description>Last year I looked at the markup of a few different food delivery services by comparing their prices against the ones on the restaurant&amp;rsquo;s menu. I got the chance to do the same thing for Instacart a few days ago when the receipt was included alongside the delivery.
The markup wasn&amp;rsquo;t as significant or variable as the food delivery apps and was just over 9% for the majority of items. I imagine the intention was to keep it single digit in case anyone did the math and 10% does seem like a reasonable markup - even with the additional tip.</description></item><item><title>Slack Idea: Hierarchical Channels</title><link>/2021/02/14/slack-idea-hierarchical-channels/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 15:32:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>/2021/02/14/slack-idea-hierarchical-channels/</guid><description>While there are a lot of strong opinions about Slack on both sides, it clearly changed the way work gets done. I&amp;rsquo;m mixed. I appreciate the ability to quickly drop a question or response asynchronous yet acknowledge how disruptive it is and prevents deep work.
The one thing that I did notice in our usage of Slack is that quite often the same message ends up being posted across multiple channels due to relevance for multiple groups.</description></item><item><title>Clubhouse as a solution to Deepfakes</title><link>/2021/01/31/clubhouse-as-a-solution-to-deepfakes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 23:37:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>/2021/01/31/clubhouse-as-a-solution-to-deepfakes/</guid><description>My mind started wandering while half-listening to a Clubhouse discussion and I had the thought that Clubhouse - and generally any real time communication app - can end up being a solution to Deepfakes. At some point Deepfakes will be good enough to render in real time but until then having synchronous communication is a way to confirm the authenticity of the participants. On top of that I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can find some blockchain way to authenticate the session to prove that it was done live and was unaltered.</description></item><item><title>Pre-internet businesses were tough</title><link>/2021/01/23/pre-internet-businesses-were-tough/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2021/01/23/pre-internet-businesses-were-tough/</guid><description>One of my favorite podcasts is NPR&amp;rsquo;s How I Built This that conducts interviews with entrepreneurs across a variety of industries, not just tech. A recent episode was an interview with Judi Sheppard Misset, the creator of Jazzercise - a dance fitness class that she launched in 1969. We all realize that there&amp;rsquo;s much less friction to launch a business these days but the interview makes you see how significant the changes have been.</description></item><item><title>Billion dollar features</title><link>/2021/01/22/billion-dollar-features/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2021/01/22/billion-dollar-features/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s an old story of Steve Jobs meeting Drew Houston in order to acquire Dropbox but after being refused calling Dropbox a feature. Dropbox kept innovating, building a great product, went public and is currently a $9 billion company. Clearly Dropbox proved Steve Jobs wrong. But did it really? Dropbox recently announced a round of layoffs and their stock has dropped 20% since they went public. Even on a personal note I plan on moving my files from Dropbox to Google Drive.</description></item><item><title>From AMP on Jekyll to Hugo and GitHub Actions</title><link>/2021/01/08/from-amp-on-jekyll-to-hugo-and-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2021/01/08/from-amp-on-jekyll-to-hugo-and-github-actions/</guid><description>This the first post written on my new blogging setup so what better topic than the new blog setup? Years ago I redesigned my entire site to use AMP across all devices, powered by Jekyll, and hosted on GitHub pages. At the end of 2020 I decided I was ready to abandon AMP and move toward a more traditional and straightforward setup while leveraging a more modern toolchain.
Due to my adoption of AMP my Jekyll/GitHub Pages setup was highly custom.</description></item><item><title>Everyone's a hustler</title><link>/2020/12/30/everyones-a-hustler/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/30/everyones-a-hustler/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s the holiday season and mine has been filled with a lot of Bing Crosby. I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people that will Wikipedia anything new and came across this sentence that describes his popularity:
&amp;ldquo;Also in 1948, Music Digest estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music&amp;rdquo;

In this case, a group of scientists proposed further limiting sugar and alcohol but the USDA didn&amp;rsquo;t include these in their official guidance. There may be some truth to the USDA&amp;rsquo;s claim that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough evidence to justify a change but I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think this is another example of strong private interest groups sacrificing the public good for themselves.</description></item><item><title>2021 goals</title><link>/2020/12/29/2021-goals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/29/2021-goals/</guid><description>Despite 2020 showing us how unpredictable the world can be, it&amp;rsquo;s that wonderful time of the year when everyone comes up with goals for the upcoming year. On one hand it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to predict what will happen but on the other hand it is useful to give some sense of purpose and direction. Being thoughtful and public around our goals is also a way to encourage us to commit and see them through completion.</description></item><item><title>Challenges in identifying a spawned OS X process</title><link>/2020/12/29/challenges-in-identifying-a-spawned-os-x-process/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/29/challenges-in-identifying-a-spawned-os-x-process/</guid><description>As part of my project to come up with a utility to deduplicate images on S3 I started working on a proof of concept to validate the flow and functionality.

Some of these are still relevant while others are woefully out of date. For example, the difference between yyyy and YYYY in Java&amp;rsquo;s SimpleDateFormat is still relevant but how to scrape web pages has changed significantly since 2013 and anything that has pricing or performance information is likely wrong.</description></item><item><title>Time to remove AMP from my blog</title><link>/2020/12/29/time-to-remove-amp-from-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/29/time-to-remove-amp-from-my-blog/</guid><description>A few years ago I redid this entire blog to use AMP - not just for mobile but also for desktop. The motivation was to improve the performance while scratching my curiosity itch. It was a fun experiment but these days I&amp;rsquo;m more averse to Google&amp;rsquo;s dominance and think I can do even better by taking what I liked from AMP but going even simpler. It took quite a bit of work to get everything working the way I wanted to in AMP - for example converting AMP markup into a valid RSS feed and getting Disqus working - and while it&amp;rsquo;ll be a shame to undo all that work it feels like the right time.</description></item><item><title>Blogging: 2020 and beyond</title><link>/2020/12/28/blogging-2020-and-beyond/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/28/blogging-2020-and-beyond/</guid><description>I have a script I use to analyze and visualize my blogging. One script generates a simple CSV file containing a variety of metadata about my blogging that I then feed into a Grafana dashboard to see how I&amp;rsquo;m doing.

We run an advertising exchange handing tens of billions of ad requests each day. AdTech has a ton of different companies with each doing a bit of everything but a simple way to think of us is an &amp;ldquo;exchange&amp;rdquo; that sits in between buyers and sellers of ads and ad space.</description></item><item><title>SpaceX Starship vs Saturn V</title><link>/2020/12/27/spacex-starship-vs-saturn-v/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/27/spacex-starship-vs-saturn-v/</guid><description>As a kid I used to be obsessed with all things space. A big part was having the same name as the head of NASA, Daniel Goldin, where I harbored illusions that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have to change the nameplate on the door. My parents supported this interest and got me subscriptions to a variety of space and science magazines. I did not go the space route but despite that I&amp;rsquo;m sure that passion and curiosity contributed to my growth and I still have a soft spot for space.</description></item><item><title>2020 donations</title><link>/2020/12/26/2020-donations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/26/2020-donations/</guid><description>Last year I wrote a short post highlighting my donations with the hope that they encourage others to donate. Given this year&amp;rsquo;s trials and tribulations it&amp;rsquo;s even more important to donate and help others if you have the means.
I continued my donations from last year and donated to the EFF, ACLU, Wikipedia, and Planned Parenthood for the same reasons as last year.

On its first day it closed at $3.84 and was relatively flat until earlier this year at which point it shot up closing at $661.77 on December 24. If you invested $1,000 at the IPO that would be worth over $172,000.

Every company has something here and as much as we can strive for perfection it&amp;rsquo;s impossible and we&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably have incidents that need handling.
I&amp;rsquo;m still thinking through the exact way to approach and summarize my thoughts but I find it useful to start with goals and first principles. The ultimate goals are to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and prevent them and other similar issues from recurring.</description></item><item><title>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure</title><link>/2020/12/23/an-ounce-of-prevention-is-worth-a-pound-of-cure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/23/an-ounce-of-prevention-is-worth-a-pound-of-cure/</guid><description>As we get into the last week of the year many software teams are in a code freeze - avoiding any deployments that may cause an incident and cause a dreaded holiday page. We have a tendency to reward the firefighter for pulling an all-nighter fighting an outage but don&amp;rsquo;t value those that avoid the fire in the first place. It&amp;rsquo;s natural to throw accolades at the firefighter since it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to see the impact in their work; it&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to see the value in the person that prevents issues from even happening.</description></item><item><title>Browser zero</title><link>/2020/12/22/browser-zero/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/22/browser-zero/</guid><description>Inbox Zero is a productivity philosophy that&amp;rsquo;s centered around getting to an empty email inbox.

The year was a tough one for most people but all things considered I&amp;rsquo;m in a privileged position and can&amp;rsquo;t blame COVID too much.

It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a contract and yet be forced to pay an additional fee for support. Even worse, this additional fee is usually a function of your existing spend.
I understand the rationale - there needs to be a cost to support otherwise everyone has an incentive to escalate and spend is likely correlated with complexity and volume of services used but it just feels as if I&amp;rsquo;m being nickel and dimed.</description></item><item><title>Blame the algorithm</title><link>/2020/12/19/blame-the-algorithm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/19/blame-the-algorithm/</guid><description>Stanford Medicine is in the news for using an &amp;ldquo;algorithm&amp;rdquo; and allocating minimal COVID vaccines to those actually on the frontlines. Instead it supposedly prioritized senior administrators who are working from home. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s some truth to the algorithm biasing allocation to those who are older but whenever I see someone blame an algorithm my spidey-sense goes off. The algorithm in this case was likely some extremely simple calculation in Excel that could have been easily verified by a human - both before it was run as well as a quick analysis of the results.</description></item><item><title>Removing duplicate files in S3</title><link>/2020/12/18/removing-duplicate-files-in-s3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/12/18/removing-duplicate-files-in-s3/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a digital hoarder and whenever I had to switch computers, I was always worried about losing files.

It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to be perfect but it&amp;rsquo;s a reminder for all of us to think through our applications and identify their failure cases.

Someone had ordered Domino&amp;rsquo;s in the UK and seemingly typed in my email address by accident.

For the US it&amp;rsquo;s a success story and a cultural export to the world.

Similarly, a pet peeve is when people say &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s not my job&amp;rdquo; and expect a problem to be fixed by someone else. Sure this may occasionally happen but it&amp;rsquo;s important to have the attitude that you&amp;rsquo;re willing to get your hands dirty in order to solve your problem and move on.
An analogy I used to represent this concept is to imagine having a house with a yard that&amp;rsquo;s next to a neighbor.</description></item><item><title>The sandpaper learning method</title><link>/2020/08/18/the-sandpaper-learning-method/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/08/18/the-sandpaper-learning-method/</guid><description>When gluing two pieces of wood it&amp;rsquo;s useful to use sandpaper to improve the effectiveness of the glue.

The reality is that unless you&amp;rsquo;re running at massive scale (Google or Facebook) your problems are more to do with big money rather than big data. It&amp;rsquo;s expensive to store, process, and expose terabytes and the difficulty is in doing it cost effectively, not in simply doing it. There are enough modern tools out there across all the cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and vendors (Snowflake, Databricks) that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to do nearly everything you want but you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to pay for it.</description></item><item><title>Traveling at the speed of light through life</title><link>/2020/08/16/traveling-at-the-speed-of-light-through-life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/08/16/traveling-at-the-speed-of-light-through-life/</guid><description>Years ago I was reading The Elegant Universe and came across a mind-blowing idea - both then and every time I remember it: we&amp;rsquo;re always traveling at the speed of light through four dimensions - the three spatial dimensions as well as time.

I&amp;rsquo;m being a bit unfair since dark mode can also be a fun side project that someone picks up and may only require changing a few colors around but if it&amp;rsquo;s anything more than that it&amp;rsquo;s an indicator that something is off with their prioritization.</description></item><item><title>Catch up with your former coworkers</title><link>/2020/06/10/catch-up-with-your-former-coworkers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/06/10/catch-up-with-your-former-coworkers/</guid><description>It used to be the case that people used to work at a company for decades, some even retired at the same company they started working at.

Critical bugs and issues fall into this but also product oversights that you wish you caught earlier.</description></item><item><title>Anatomy of a crypto mining hack</title><link>/2020/05/29/anatomy-of-a-crypto-mining-hack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/29/anatomy-of-a-crypto-mining-hack/</guid><description>A few months ago I set up a simple ftp server to help a friend. I took a few security shortcuts which came to bite me this week when I received an alert from DigitalOcean that an instance was running hot.
I dug into it and noticed a series of processes being run by the ftp_user - the most impactful was a command called rsync. I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with rsync which syncs files across devices - and this was nothing like that.</description></item><item><title>Metrics, logging, and error reporting</title><link>/2020/05/27/metrics-logging-and-error-reporting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/27/metrics-logging-and-error-reporting/</guid><description>As software engineers it’s vital to understand how our applications are performing. The more information we have the better we can address problems, improve performance, and generally better solve problems for our customers. Imagine releasing a product with nothing being collected - you&amp;rsquo;d be flying blind.
I&amp;rsquo;m a huge advocate for measuring application performance in terms of business metrics and aligning it as much with the customer experience as possible. This post does not go into that.</description></item><item><title>Stock portfolio hedging during the coronavirus pandemic</title><link>/2020/05/23/stock-portfolio-hedging-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/23/stock-portfolio-hedging-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/</guid><description>I have had the majority of my liquid wealth invested in the stock market and I wanted to share what I&amp;rsquo;m doing these days. As a bit of a background, at the beginning of the year my portfolio primarily consisted of the tech companies I&amp;rsquo;ve held for years - Netflix, Amazon, Equinix, Google, and Facebook. After the first decline I liquidated about half of my portfolio - my thinking was that I&amp;rsquo;m still long term bullish about these companies and they will likely emerge stronger but I should hold on to some of my gains and have a bit of cash.</description></item><item><title>Prefer verbs to adverbs</title><link>/2020/05/21/prefer-verbs-to-adverbs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/21/prefer-verbs-to-adverbs/</guid><description>Years ago I read a book that I unfortunately can&amp;rsquo;t recall that had a very insightful bit of writing advice - prefer verbs to adverbs. The premise was that many of us will spice up our writing by using adverbs to decorate our verbs but instead we should use strong and unique verbs. Your writing gains pithiness and leads to a more memorable message.
As an example, rather than prepending &amp;ldquo;said&amp;rdquo; with yet another adverb instead think of verbs that get your point across better - maybe it&amp;rsquo;s shouted, or exclaimed, or charged, or yelled, or accused, or hundreds others.</description></item><item><title>Shopify for food delivery</title><link>/2020/05/21/shopify-for-food-delivery/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/21/shopify-for-food-delivery/</guid><description>I wrote about the idea of a service that aggregates delivery drivers back in 2018 but given the latest wave of food delivery service bashing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of it again.

Tabula rasa, Latin for blank slate, is a philosophical concept dating back to Aristotle to explain how human minds are blank from the beginning and acquire knowledge through the human experience.
I think of it as being able to approach new challenges and experiences with no prior bias. Done well, this is an incredible power since you&amp;rsquo;re able to cut through the complexity and focus on what actually matters.</description></item><item><title>Sometimes it really is just the dirty, hard work</title><link>/2020/05/02/sometimes-it-really-is-just-the-dirty-hard-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/02/sometimes-it-really-is-just-the-dirty-hard-work/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of only wanting to do the new and sexy thing and giving up as soon as something requires the dirty work.

We&amp;rsquo;re nearly 5 months into the year and I&amp;rsquo;ve written only two posts even relating to management. A big reason is impostor syndrome - while I have only been managing a few years there are so many others that have more experience, are better managers, and are more effective writers. At the same time, the lack of experience hasn&amp;rsquo;t really stopped me from writing on other topics though so why should this be any different?</description></item><item><title>Margin of victory</title><link>/2020/04/24/margin-of-victory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/04/24/margin-of-victory/</guid><description>During the AlphaGo documentary there&amp;rsquo;s a scene where the AI makes a very conservative move that the commentary notes is very different from what a human would do. The explanation is that AlphaGo doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about the margin of victory, just the victory itself. It&amp;rsquo;s trying to maximize the likelihood of winning, not the score differential - and that leads to a unique playing style.

At the same time you should watch it - it&amp;rsquo;s an incredible film.
I watched the AlphaGo documentary and it left a powerful impression on me.
The accomplishment by the AlphaGo team is incredible. At the same time I felt incredibly sad watching it and became slightly depressed. It felt very much like a man vs machine battle yet the machine was a huge team of engineers with nearly unlimited resources.</description></item><item><title>Google and Apple's COVID tracking project</title><link>/2020/04/18/google-and-apples-covid-tracking-project/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/04/18/google-and-apples-covid-tracking-project/</guid><description>Google and Apple recently announced a partnership to help people anonymously see if they&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to someone with COVID. The idea itself is elegant and does a nice job balancing the functionality with the need for privacy.

I think the opposite. I believe that with enough marketing this will be a massive success.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing code?

More importantly, and this is pure speculation, it seems as if you pick a random person and look at their social network usage it&amp;rsquo;s very likely they&amp;rsquo;re spending the majority, if not all of their time, in only one of those networks.</description></item><item><title>Build for optionality</title><link>/2020/01/03/build-for-optionality/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/01/03/build-for-optionality/</guid><description>I wrote a company wide email back in September titled &amp;ldquo;Building for optionality&amp;rdquo; that describes how our engineering team maintains its impact despite the growing complexity of the business.

My approach is to strive to make that complexity linear rather than multiplicative.

A linear approach is one where this additional requirement forces you to think through others in its class but not much beyond that.</description></item><item><title>Solve categories, not individual problems</title><link>/2019/12/10/solve-categories-not-individual-problems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/10/solve-categories-not-individual-problems/</guid><description>One of the most valuable abilities in modern software development is the ability to solve entire categories of issues instead of the immediate problem in front of us.

I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are better and more modern tools out there but we&amp;rsquo;ve been using SiftScience&amp;rsquo;s kafka-assigner. Rather than being a naive partitioning it looks at the existing assignments and optimizes the new assignment to minimize the number of moves while striving to keep the partitions evenly distributed across all brokers.</description></item><item><title>SSO and SAAS pricing</title><link>/2019/09/28/sso-and-saas-pricing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/09/28/sso-and-saas-pricing/</guid><description>For a very long time I wondered why SSO was always listed as a premium feature across nearly every enterprise software pricing page but no more!

What if we each had our own personal dashboard that measured what was important to us?</description></item><item><title>Ideal tech intern projects</title><link>/2019/07/09/ideal-tech-intern-projects/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/09/ideal-tech-intern-projects/</guid><description>Having a tech internship program is a big investment that companies should not undertake without making sure they can put in the work to make it successful. Some companies approach it as a source of extra help but without giving the interns the support they need it will end up in hurt productivity for them and the rest of the team.
The ultimate goal of an internship is to provide useful work, determine whether there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity for a full time role, and sell the candidate on that opportunity.</description></item><item><title>Power of habit</title><link>/2019/07/08/power-of-habit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/08/power-of-habit/</guid><description>Last year I feel behind my writing and had to scramble starting in November to hit my goal of two blog posts a week. I unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t start this year strong and am already behind. In the first half of the year I should have written 52 posts but I&amp;rsquo;m currently at 24, just under half off the goal. This is not great if I want to have a somewhat normal November and December where I&amp;rsquo;m not spending nearly every free moment of the day writing so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a post every day in July in order to eat into the debt.</description></item><item><title>Video of my Data Council NYC talk</title><link>/2019/07/07/video-of-my-data-council-nyc-talk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/07/video-of-my-data-council-nyc-talk/</guid><description>Last November I gave a talk at Data Council NYC &amp;lsquo;18 titled &amp;ldquo;The Highs and Lows of Building an Adtech Data Pipeline&amp;rdquo; and finally saw that the video has been uploaded to YouTube.

The argument is that the market is efficient and if there was a way to drop them one of the credit card providers would have to gain an advantage.
I don&amp;rsquo;t buy this argument. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the history of merchant fees but my suspicion is that they changed minimally, if at all, over the past few decades despite the massive amount of data being collected and the processing capability to go with it.</description></item><item><title>Future of cloud is hybrid</title><link>/2019/07/05/future-of-cloud-is-hybrid/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/07/05/future-of-cloud-is-hybrid/</guid><description>Cloud providers are doing all they can to lock companies into their own offerings but my suspicion is that the future looks hybrid.

Last year I wrote a post proposing that all laws should be temporary and upon expiration require a higher and higher majority to be sustained.

The concept is rooted in the idea that political parties can divide voting areas in order to bias the populations in their favor. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense that in a functional democracy voting districts can be so easily manipulated.
The fact that one sees numerous examples of the ridiculous geographic shapes that can develop should be sign-enough that it&amp;rsquo;s an irrational approach.</description></item><item><title>Free as in puppy</title><link>/2019/04/23/free-as-in-puppy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/04/23/free-as-in-puppy/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve known about &amp;ldquo;free as in beer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;free as in speech&amp;rdquo; for a while now but only recently have I learned about &amp;ldquo;free as in puppy.&amp;rdquo; I came across the phrase while reading a Stratechery article describing various ways of thinking about regulation.

This was a surprise - throughout its history Airbnb has made a point to compete with hotels and my gut was that hotels would not be too happy to partner with a competitor. I understand that Airbnb is trying to grow before their inevitable IPO and to do so they need to invest in growth. I also subscribe to the argument that from their standpoint they’re focused on giving people a place to stay and not necessarily that concerned with the exact medium - private rental or hotel or whatever else.</description></item><item><title>LinkedIn's terrible messaging experience</title><link>/2019/03/10/linkedins-terrible-messaging-experience/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/03/10/linkedins-terrible-messaging-experience/</guid><description>This is a bit of a ranty post but it’s incredible how poor the LinkedIn messaging experience is.

Yet the past few few months we’ve seen two major companies increase prices - Atlassian and Netflix - without any adverse effects. The products are improving and are offering more functionality so it’s only fair that the prices increase. This is a welcome sign and I hope it leads to companies starting to invest significantly more in improving their existing products with the expectation that they’ll be able to raise prices in line with the additional value they’re bringing.</description></item><item><title>Modernizing Makers Alley and Better404</title><link>/2019/01/27/modernizing-makers-alley-and-better404/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/01/27/modernizing-makers-alley-and-better404/</guid><description>Years ago I started two companies, Makers Alley and Better404, and while they were both failures I didn’t have the heart to shut down the site.

This is a friendly reminder that when formatting dates in Java’s SimpleDateFormat class there is a subtle difference between YYYY and yyyy.

The biggest challenge so far has been migrating secrets across computers.</description></item><item><title>Visualizing my blog: 2018 edition</title><link>/2018/12/26/visualizing-my-blog-2018-edition/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/26/visualizing-my-blog-2018-edition/</guid><description>Last year I came up with a set of scripts to analyze my blog and thought it would be interesting to rerun them this year to see what&amp;rsquo;s changed. There are a ton of visualizations up on GitHub but most are just a fun visual without actually telling a story. I&amp;rsquo;ve included the most important ones below with a bit of analysis and commentary. It also looks as if the charts are getting too messy for multiple years of data so I&amp;rsquo;ll need to revisit the visualizations for 2019.</description></item><item><title>Happy holidays from Visual Studio Code</title><link>/2018/12/25/happy-holidays-from-visual-studio-code/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/25/happy-holidays-from-visual-studio-code/</guid><description>Visual Studio Code has been my go-to editor since the beginning of 2017 and I’m a huge fan.

Given the fact that I’ve been extremely behind in writing this year and am only catching up now it’s clear that 2018 was a weaker year than previous ones. Sorting all pages viewed in 2018 by descending pageviews the first post written in 2018 is in the 57th spot - every other post was written in prior years.</description></item><item><title>Calendars as streaming events</title><link>/2018/12/24/calendars-as-streaming-events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/24/calendars-as-streaming-events/</guid><description>I like calendars. They appeal to both my sense of organization and efficiency but also to the actual depth of the technical implementation. It’s not easy creating a good calendar application - you have to think about all sorts of edge cases - for example rescheduling an event that was part of a recurring series or the usual time zone nonsense. A thought I keep going back to is treating calendars as event streams.</description></item><item><title>Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary Government Data Act</title><link>/2018/12/24/open-public-electronic-and-necessary-government-data-act/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/24/open-public-electronic-and-necessary-government-data-act/</guid><description>The US Congress recently passed HR-4174 (The Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary Government Data Act) which is intended to make all public government data available and accessible. Over the years I’ve done my fair share of poking around various government datasets - both public and private - and while the data was generally available it was rarely accessible. More often than not the data would be available via a scanned PDF which required some heavy OCR work to extract anything useful or the slightly easier PDF parsing code.</description></item><item><title>Solve all web app performance problems with SQL</title><link>/2018/12/24/solve-all-web-app-performance-problems-with-sql/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/24/solve-all-web-app-performance-problems-with-sql/</guid><description>The title is clearly tongue in cheek but a very large number of web application issues can be solved through better SQL. Web applications performance problems are either UI or API related. And if the performance is on the API side it&amp;rsquo;s likely due to slow queries. The majority of endpoints are doing some form of database interaction and many are making multiple database calls. It only takes one of these to be slow to make the entire application feel sluggish - especially if you have lots of concurrent requests to this endpoint.</description></item><item><title>Quora's revenue model</title><link>/2018/12/23/quoras-revenue-model/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/23/quoras-revenue-model/</guid><description>While browsing a Hacker News thread about Quora I came across the following exchange:
I had always assumed Quora made money through ads and didn’t even consider that they had another revenue stream. The Hacker News thread indicates that they have a substantial revenue stream coming from selling the Q&amp;amp;A data to AI/ML companies but I haven’t been able to find anything else that supports this. Part of the difficulty in searching for results is that just by typing in “Quora” the results are biased towards Quora itself.</description></item><item><title>Edge moving to Chromium</title><link>/2018/12/22/edge-moving-to-chromium/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/22/edge-moving-to-chromium/</guid><description>I’m a bit late to the party but it’s unbelievable that Microsoft is going to move future versions of Edge to be built on top of Chromium. This is shocking. I can’t separate Internet Explorer from Microsoft.

I don’t know whether my expectations are higher than the typical guests but in a significant number of my stays the wifi has been spotty.

The nice thing thing is that this is entirely doable - both because you can connect to the network but also because you have access to the physical router.</description></item><item><title>Global roaming</title><link>/2018/12/21/global-roaming/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/21/global-roaming/</guid><description>It’s amazing how quickly we become entitled to new technological advances.

The premise is that Amazon is incredibly strong operationally and both their integration of Echo into all things home and their acquisition of Ring gives them valuable signals that the typical insurer does not have.

Computer science has the concept of “Big O notation” to measure how a function behaves as a function of it’s input.</description></item><item><title>Overanalyzing Medium's tag suggestions</title><link>/2018/12/15/overanalyzing-mediums-tag-suggestions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/15/overanalyzing-mediums-tag-suggestions/</guid><description>While I keep my primary blog on dangoldin.com I also cross post to Medium to get some more views but also because I’m curious to compare the performance.

AWS on the other hand is bills entirely based on usage and has to allocate the additional hardware for every customer and is definitely not zero marginal cost.</description></item><item><title>EMR vs Databricks costs</title><link>/2018/12/10/emr-vs-databricks-costs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/12/10/emr-vs-databricks-costs/</guid><description>It’s frustrating when vendors introduce their own currency in what seems to be a way to obfuscate pricing.

A while back I read an article that calculated how much additional revenue Google would be able to generate if they put ads on their homepage. I don’t recall the exact number or the details but I imagine it’s a massive amount.</description></item><item><title>Aggressive code deprecation</title><link>/2018/11/25/aggressive-code-deprecation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/25/aggressive-code-deprecation/</guid><description>Part of writing high quality code quickly is deprecating no longer used features and functionality. It sounds simple but more often than not there’s an abundance of references throughout - some tightly coupled and others loosely coupled - that make a full deprecation difficult. In some cases it’s is as simple as an isolated code change while in other cases it’s removing code along with some database migrations and in the extreme case it may be removing an entire service.</description></item><item><title>Exploring my backlinks</title><link>/2018/11/25/exploring-my-backlinks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/25/exploring-my-backlinks/</guid><description>I enjoy Hacker Noon and often find myself coming across an interesting article on the site.

One of the biggest is defining the functionality and how it should be exposed to the users. In my mind, answers to this question like on a spectrum. On one extreme you have the “take what you can get” approach where the functionality is exposed with no customization and no advanced features but the experience is optimized for one specific use case. As an example of this think of the original Google search - a single search field, minimal search functionality, and two buttons.</description></item><item><title>Code without online help</title><link>/2018/11/24/code-without-online-help/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/24/code-without-online-help/</guid><description>Whenever I need some coding help my first step is to do an online search which usually leads me to either the library documentation or a StackOverflow page. This is a poor habit and something I’m trying to move away from. While I’m almost always online it’s dangerous to rely on the internet to code - both because there will be times you may not have internet access but also because you lose the ability to do your own investigation, discovery, and critical thinking.</description></item><item><title>Electronic goods are cheaper than ever</title><link>/2018/11/23/electronic-goods-are-cheaper-than-ever/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/23/electronic-goods-are-cheaper-than-ever/</guid><description>While stumbling across yet another Black Friday deal it hit me that electronics are ridiculously cheap. One can get state of the art computers for about a thousand dollars and huge flat panel TVs for a few hundred dollars. I grew up in the 90s and it never felt that comparable gadgets were that cheap. It may be that I didn’t have a job and nearly everything was out of reach but I suspect electronic goods really are that much cheaper now.</description></item><item><title>History's largest empires</title><link>/2018/11/22/historys-largest-empires/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/22/historys-largest-empires/</guid><description>I got a bit distracted today and ended up coming across the Wikipedia page listing history’s largest empires. The page came with a list of the top 140 by land area and just by looking at them you can see there’s a huge range. The British Empire was the largest at 35.5 million square kilometers while the Sumer was the smallest at 0.05. That’s a huge difference - over 700 times - and I thought it would be interesting to plot them to visualize the distribution.</description></item><item><title>Superhuman review</title><link>/2018/11/21/superhuman-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/21/superhuman-review/</guid><description>I’m all about productivity so when I heard about Superhuman I decided to give it a shot. I’ve been using it for the past few weeks and while it’s a solid product and well built it didn’t suit me. The onboarding experience is great and there’s a ton of functionality that Superhuman provides that makes it that much easier to go through email. This ranges from a variety of shortcuts (that can all be quickly found using Cmd+K) to functionality that you wish existed in email, such as typing a date and immediately seeing that day’s calendar to being able to copy a whole email message - attachments and all.</description></item><item><title>My DataEngConf 2018 talk</title><link>/2018/11/20/my-dataengconf-2018-talk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/20/my-dataengconf-2018-talk/</guid><description>On November 9th I had the privilege of speaking at DataEngConf under the “Hero Engineering” track.

We live in such a digital heavy world that it’s difficult to imagine life without it. Yet it really is fairly recent. Personal computers only started becoming popular in the 1980s and the internet was only introduced in the 1990s. And it took a whole decade before the internet started resembling what we currently see. If we take the least restrictive definition of a computer we still get that computers have existed for less than a hundred years.</description></item><item><title>Falling behind my 2018 blogging goal</title><link>/2018/11/18/falling-behind-my-2018-blogging-goal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/18/falling-behind-my-2018-blogging-goal/</guid><description>Since 2013 I’ve been writing 2 blog posts a week.

One of the tricks I’ve been using is to disable all images and avoid clicking any links that don’t go directly to the desired location. The reason for disabling images is that it prevents your opening of the email from being tracked since the image request (which contains some unique identifier) does not get made.</description></item><item><title>What messaging war?</title><link>/2018/11/14/what-messaging-war/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/14/what-messaging-war/</guid><description>Apparently there’s a “messaging war” going on among the dozens of apps and social networks, all competing to be the dominant messaging app. There really are a ton of these.

The UX for this is usually pretty normal - you select the object, hit the icon to modify the color, and choose a new color. Usually it’s slightly better and you get to see the existing color. What surprised me with the Google Slides experience is that I didn’t just see the existing color but also saw the previously picked color.</description></item><item><title>Social Security Administration spoofing scam</title><link>/2018/11/12/social-security-administration-spoofing-scam/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/11/12/social-security-administration-spoofing-scam/</guid><description>I use Google Voice as my voicemail due to the built in transcription which lets me tell at a glance whether a call is spam or in the rare case, worth returning.

What’s both sad and amazing is how accurate the new Gmail autocompletions (officially called Smart Compose) have gotten. They’re incredibly accurate for common phrases and are likely leveraging very similar technology to what Google is using for their autocomplete search. It’s great for finishing off that last sentence and even acts as a real time phrase thesaurus that helps suggest alternate phrasing.</description></item><item><title>Just ship it</title><link>/2018/10/25/just-ship-it/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/10/25/just-ship-it/</guid><description>I don’t know whether it’s the pace of modern life or something else but I no longer have a good intuition for recent events.

The gig economy is clearly here to stay and it’s encouraging that we’re seeing companies trying to adapt to the changes.

I normally use Chrome but a few days ago I had to do some browser testing in Safari and discovered that the two browsers handle incognito mode differently. Chrome’s incognito mode will share cookies across all incognito tabs - equivalent to running another instance of Chrome. Safari, on the other hand, will give each tab as its own cookie store.</description></item><item><title>Yahoo fantasy football stats: 2018-2019 edition</title><link>/2018/08/18/yahoo-fantasy-football-stats-2018-2019-edition/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/08/18/yahoo-fantasy-football-stats-2018-2019-edition/</guid><description>This is much later than in previous years but hopefully that just makes the data more accurate.

Relatedly, a few days I read an article describing how Google is also pushing Duplex to be used in call centers.

The only way of securely sharing data with third parties is to not actually give it to them.</description></item><item><title>Facebook's "breach"</title><link>/2018/03/18/facebooks-breach/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/03/18/facebooks-breach/</guid><description>The big news this weekend was that Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica, a company that leveraged behavioral data to come up with very focused and accurate political ads, for using data that they were not supposed to have as well as not deleting it when caught. Everyone seems to be surprised by this revelation but I’m honestly surprised it took this long and I wouldn’t be surprised if there are still hundreds, or even thousands, of companies in the same situation as Cambridge Analytica, albeit at a smaller scale.</description></item><item><title>Crowdsourced data</title><link>/2018/03/11/crowdsourced-data/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/03/11/crowdsourced-data/</guid><description>Open source has become a critical part of modern software development that allows small teams to move quickly and do in months what used to take years. This has been driven by massive platforms, such as GitHub, that make it extremely easy to find useful code, contribute back, and provide feedback, comments, and requests.
Unfortunately, data hasn’t seen as strong of an open sourcing trend.

If I want to read a book I’ll only get a physical version if the Kindle version is unavailable. It’s often cheaper, immediately available, takes up no space, and comes with a variety of annotation abilities. My biggest frustration has been how difficult it’s been to export my highlights. I will often highlight interesting passages and quotes and every few weeks will dump them into a giant text file that I will occasionally reference or search.</description></item><item><title>Analyzing AWS ELB logs</title><link>/2018/02/20/analyzing-aws-elb-logs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/02/20/analyzing-aws-elb-logs/</guid><description>Logging HTTP requests should be enabled for every application you run. When things go wrong, and they will, it’s often the first step to understand the problem. Unfortunately, logging isn’t always top of mind and is often forgotten. Luckily, if you use the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) functionality within AWS you’re able to set up ELB logs that track every request and write it to an S3 bucket. The documentation is up on the Amazon site but there’s a surprising amount of information that’s hidden away in the logs.</description></item><item><title>Optimize for keyboard shortcuts</title><link>/2018/02/10/optimize-for-keyboard-shortcuts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/02/10/optimize-for-keyboard-shortcuts/</guid><description>I’m a big believer of offering keyboard-only experiences to your power users. In fact, I don’t think it’s possible to build a loved productivity application without keyboard shortcuts. Productivity applications are all about productivity and keyboard shortcuts are what give your users power and speed. The mouse and menus are easier for newcomers but those that stick with the application inevitably need the speed that comes from shortcuts.
The ultimate example of this is Excel.</description></item><item><title>Making the most of the subway commute</title><link>/2018/02/09/making-the-most-of-the-subway-commute/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/02/09/making-the-most-of-the-subway-commute/</guid><description>Every day I take the subway to and from work and can’t help but think how that time could be better spent.

I’m not sure if Apple is even contributing anything to these but even if they are I suspect the branding outweighs the investment - especially since an ad viewer may decide to get the new iPhone regardless of their existing carrier.</description></item><item><title>Scale challenges with AWS Athena</title><link>/2017/10/14/scale-challenges-with-aws-athena/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/10/14/scale-challenges-with-aws-athena/</guid><description>Almost a year ago, AWS launched Athena which allowed you to query data directly off of S3. I loved the idea since it would allow us to simplify our workflow by reducing the need for Spark and Redshift while also cutting our costs. In theory queries that were being run via Spark or Redshift could just be run on top of data stored in S3 without having to load it into any system.</description></item><item><title>Downloading your AIM buddy list</title><link>/2017/10/09/downloading-your-aim-buddy-list/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/10/09/downloading-your-aim-buddy-list/</guid><description>While writing the most recent post about the impending AIM shut down I became curious and logged in to see what what I’ve been missing.

There’s a huge different in quality and joy when you compare consumer apps with government services.

Amazon’s an incredibly competitive company with a ton of defensive moats but one I haven’t seen mentioned much is also the one I think is one of the most powerful: its sheer number of employees. And rather than having them isolated to a few key offices they’re spread out across a variety of cities, states, and countries. Amazon has over 340,000 employees which is almost 5 times the size of Google’s 72,000.</description></item><item><title>Focus on the story</title><link>/2017/08/28/focus-on-the-story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/08/28/focus-on-the-story/</guid><description>Last week we hosted a meetup describing the evolution of our data pipeline over the past 5 years - starting with a simple script to aggregate log files to a fully fledged big data system relying on a slew of technologies ranging from Kafka to Spark to Redshift.

Lambda architectures are designed for systems that contain massive amounts of streaming data that needs to be processed and exposed quickly. The architecture consists of two different systems. One is a real time pipeline that’s not perfectly accurate but is able to handle large volumes while providing a solid estimate quickly. The other is a batch process that is accurate but runs on a delay.</description></item><item><title>Death of retail</title><link>/2017/08/22/death-of-retail/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/08/22/death-of-retail/</guid><description>I keep hearing that retail is dying and while I do believe that to be true it’s been difficult to see that from living in the NYC area.

In an ideal world we’d have everything we need in fixtures and properly tested but in the cases we don’t it seems simpler to just copy the data over from the production environment.</description></item><item><title>The different flavors of engineering interviews</title><link>/2017/05/17/the-different-flavors-of-engineering-interviews/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/05/17/the-different-flavors-of-engineering-interviews/</guid><description>Technical interviews often come in a variety of flavors and I thought it would be interesting to list as many as I can think of and my thoughts on each one.

More often you find people passionate about a few domains that are the most relevant to them and don’t bother pursuing knowledge of anything new. This mindset is both sad and irritating - why would someone consciously limit their knowledge?
Beyond knowledge for knowledge’s sake it’s valuable to train your mind to learn and absorb information; you never know when it can come in handy.</description></item><item><title>Using options to play Snapchat's quarterly results</title><link>/2017/05/10/using-options-to-play-snapchats-quarterly-results/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/05/10/using-options-to-play-snapchats-quarterly-results/</guid><description>I rarely write about finance but a decade ago I did a stint in finance and picked up a few things. One of these was the idea of options which are an interesting and powerful way to participate in the market.

Some languages, such as Haskell, have wonderful and elegant design and are a joy to write but mostly remain hobby languages. Other languages, on the other hand, such as Java, may be rote and uninspired but have a massive amount of supported tools that allow them to keep growing. Unless we’re exploring or playing around the ultimate goal of every line of code we write is for it to be deployed to production and solid tools allow that to happen.</description></item><item><title>Security across multiple AWS regions</title><link>/2017/05/04/security-across-multiple-aws-regions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/05/04/security-across-multiple-aws-regions/</guid><description>As great as AWS is there’s still a major gap in the way cross-region support are handled. It’s boggling that there’s no single screen to see every one of your instances and you’re forced to do it a region at a time. Beyond the cosmetic it’s not-obvious how to get instances from multiple regions to communicate securely with one another. On one hand Amazon has the neat concept of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that allows you to create a group of machines that act as if they’re on the same network.</description></item><item><title>Having some fun with the RGB color model</title><link>/2017/04/30/having-some-fun-with-the-rgb-color-model/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/04/30/having-some-fun-with-the-rgb-color-model/</guid><description>The best way to learn a new technology is to play with it so to learn React I started a simple project I termed “color-fun&amp;quot; (GitHub).

It really does feel we’re in the golden age of big data tools. The rise of cloud computing, distributed storage, and the proliferation of open source have led to multiple orders of magnitude more data generated now than a decade ago.

Nearly all code is taking some data, transforming it, and passing it along somewhere else. This implies that modifications change or add to this flow. It may be passing an additional variable to a function, changing the behavior of a function, or adding another step in our execution. It turns out that if the code is poorly written a seemingly minor change may require changing a series of functions since for some reason each function in the flow needs to be modified.</description></item><item><title>Slack's channel exit anti pattern</title><link>/2017/04/02/slacks-channel-exit-anti-pattern/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/04/02/slacks-channel-exit-anti-pattern/</guid><description>Slack has grown incredibly quickly and solves a difficult problem but I can’t help but notice that some design antipatterns that increase Slack usage but don’t benefit the user.

The way it works is that Amazon offers a Fulfillment by Amazon (called FBA) option where a merchant sends their items to Amazon’s warehouse which is then eligible for Prime shipping since it’s just going to be shipped by Amazon. The way Amazon implements this is by commingling the items - so if two merchants send Amazon the same item Amazon will treat it as the same item when it comes to consumers.</description></item><item><title>The effects of marketing on price</title><link>/2017/03/25/the-effects-of-marketing-on-price/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/03/25/the-effects-of-marketing-on-price/</guid><description>I like to think of myself as extremely relational and efficient and something that’s always bothered me is marketing.

I’ve been keeping meticulous daily stats around the hours slept, my physical and mental states over the course of a day, as well as the food, coffee, tea, soda, and alcohol consumed and the review is an opportunity for me to summarize and visualize this data.</description></item><item><title>Amazon's peer to peer marketplace</title><link>/2016/12/31/amazons-peer-to-peer-marketplace/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/12/31/amazons-peer-to-peer-marketplace/</guid><description>It looks as if Amazon is entering yet another market - the local peer to peer marketplace. They just launched a peer to peer marketplace in Bangalore. The pitch is incredibly simple - you create a listing and it’s listed on Amazon. As soon as it’s sold Amazon will pick up the item and deliver it to the buyer. I’ve used Craigslist a ton in the past and coordinating the delivery and handoff was always a frustrating experience.</description></item><item><title>Favorite books of 2016</title><link>/2016/12/31/favorite-books-of-2016/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/12/31/favorite-books-of-2016/</guid><description>I have a longer post planned taking a quantified self approach to my 2016 but I wanted to share my favorite books of 2016. Looking at this list the primary themes were rediscovering my love for science fiction, digging deeper into society and culture, getting back into history - both focused on technology but also the world.

The counterargument is that every time there has been a technological improvement new, higher value jobs have been created that more than offset the loss.

This gives me something relaxing to do in the evenings after a day spent running around but also adds another dimension to my trip. The history heightens my experience when exploring the city since I’m able to relate what I read to the real world - be it landmarks, sculptures, or the culture.</description></item><item><title>Comparing public transit systems: New York vs London</title><link>/2016/12/24/comparing-public-transit-systems-new-york-vs-london/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/12/24/comparing-public-transit-systems-new-york-vs-london/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m behind on my 2 blog posts per week goal since I&amp;rsquo;m traveling and want see as much as I can but plan on catching up next week when I&amp;rsquo;m back.

This encourages us to improve our tools and languages to accommodate new patterns and challenges. Many of these improvements have come due to better hardware since we&amp;rsquo;re better able to cope with slight inefficiencies at the expense of higher productivity. This, coupled with the constant advancement of compilers and interpreters, has led to a massive adoption of scripting languages.
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the trade-offs we accept when we use scripting languages.</description></item><item><title>Automatically taking screenshots of HTML elements</title><link>/2016/12/13/automatically-taking-screenshots-of-html-elements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/12/13/automatically-taking-screenshots-of-html-elements/</guid><description>I’ve worked on a variety of scraping projects that required spinning up a browser (via selenium) and having it browse a variety of pages unattended in order to capture some data. The two most recents ones scraping my account data from Turo and the fantasy football stats from Yahoo. These were relatively straightforward since the browser was used purely to navigate from page to page with the actual data capture done by parsing the underlying HTML.</description></item><item><title>Word clouds and text similarity</title><link>/2016/12/10/word-clouds-and-text-similarity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/12/10/word-clouds-and-text-similarity/</guid><description>I’m a sucker for data visualizations so when I came across a simple word cloud-generating Python script I knew I had to give it a shot.

Last week I was working on a simple script to parse and visualize a detailed AWS bill across a variety of dimensions and came across a clear example. The script loads a CSV file into a Pandas dataframe and adds a few columns based on the values of some others. The challenge is that the CSV file can be millions of rows so minor improvements can lead to significant efficiency gains.</description></item><item><title>Read the release notes</title><link>/2016/12/03/read-the-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/12/03/read-the-release-notes/</guid><description>I often find myself upgrading an open source to a newer version but I have a bad habit to only skim the release notes. More often than not an upgrade will work out of the box and you’ll get the immediate benefits of the newer version but every once in a while things blow up and you need to revert or scramble to get a fix out. Reading documentation tends to be dry with only a few relevant parts but when working on large systems it’s paramount to go through and understand the nuances of every upgrade.</description></item><item><title>Becoming a better developer</title><link>/2016/11/30/becoming-a-better-developer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/11/30/becoming-a-better-developer/</guid><description>Yesterday I had the privilege of giving a talk at HackReactor titled “Things I wish I knew” which was an amalgam of the various themes and topics I’ve been blogging and thinking about.

In fact, AWS even provides their own service, Trusted Advisor, that competes with the external vendors. Unfortunately, these vendors can get expensive quickly. The first useful tier of Trusted Advisor, categorized as Business, has a tiered pricing model based on your existing usage that starts at 10% of your AWS bill and decreases to 3% as you spend past $250k/month.</description></item><item><title>Joy of old code</title><link>/2016/11/19/joy-of-old-code/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/11/19/joy-of-old-code/</guid><description>I have over 50 repositories on GitHub with the majority being one time projects that were either me exploring a new technology, writing a small script, or doing a quick data analysis and visualization project. Every once in awhile when I’m a bit nostalgic I’ll go through these old projects and mend some of the code.

I rediscovered this script while digging through my old projects this week and thought it would be an interesting analysis to redo this analysis and see how it compared against the data from 2014.</description></item><item><title>Recursive redirects with AWS Lambda</title><link>/2016/11/13/recursive-redirects-with-aws-lambda/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/11/13/recursive-redirects-with-aws-lambda/</guid><description>Two years ago I toyed around with an odd idea of implementing recursion over HTTP redirects. The idea is that the state is managed through the query string arguments and at each recursive step we just redirect to the URL for the next one.

Beyond that one has to set up a coordination service, typically ZooKeeper, to handle a litany of concurrency and failure issues. These days having a data pipeline is a requirement for any data driven business but building a true streaming data pipeline entails a ton of dedicated effort.</description></item><item><title>Restricted highlighting on the Amazon Kindle</title><link>/2016/11/06/restricted-highlighting-on-the-amazon-kindle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/11/06/restricted-highlighting-on-the-amazon-kindle/</guid><description>I love to read so it took me a surprisingly long time to get a Kindle. Before then I felt fine either just grabbing a physical book or using a tablet or a phone. LCD displays never bothered me so I figured I might as well get the responsiveness and additional functionality of a tablet rather than a single-use device. But earlier this year I spent some time using my wife’s Kindle and loved the form factor as well as the battery life.</description></item><item><title>The NFL abroad</title><link>/2016/10/30/the-nfl-abroad/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/10/30/the-nfl-abroad/</guid><description>NFL viewership is down 10% this season and I understand the desire to grow the brand and the sport abroad. It seems misguided to take a product that’s declining in popularity and rather than fixing the core problems to try to grow it as is. This is akin to a tech startup marketing the hell out of a product that’s unable to retain its existing customers. The proper approach is to nail the product before trying to push it into the market.</description></item><item><title>Simple data visualizations from the command line</title><link>/2016/10/26/simple-data-visualizations-from-the-command-line/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/10/26/simple-data-visualizations-from-the-command-line/</guid><description>Lately I’ve been doing a variety of quick data investigations and they typically follow the same formula: write a query to fetch some simple data, copy and paste into Excel, do a minimal amount of manipulation, plot the results.

Since so much of our world is digital it costs the government nothing extra to collect each additional data point. Given these incentives it’s no surprise that the government was able to get the major companies to provide a dedicated feed of the data they were collecting - modern technology has enabled both the collection and analysis of massive amounts of data.</description></item><item><title>iOS wifi security recommendation</title><link>/2016/10/02/ios-wifi-security-recommendation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/10/02/ios-wifi-security-recommendation/</guid><description>While exploring the city earlier today I ended up wandering too close to the Google building and somehow got connected to their guest wifi network, GoogleGuest, and noticed that iOS 10 gave me an “Security Recommendation” notification.

The first few weeks at a new office it’s wonderful to know you can find a room whenever you need it.

Even if my hands are a little bit sweaty or not completely dry it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to unlock the phone. Yet as soon as they’re dry the phone immediately unlocks. What’s surprising, especially given Apple&amp;rsquo;s focus on delivering the perfect user experience, is that this is still a problem. I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with the hardware behind Touch ID but even if there&amp;rsquo;s some sort of warped fingerprint it should be good enough.</description></item><item><title>Automating management</title><link>/2016/09/18/automating-management/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/09/18/automating-management/</guid><description>One of the biggest lessons I learned when I became an engineering manager was how important the basic operational elements.

The data contained the weekly projections for that week’s top 100 scorers which amounted to 1700 rows - note that this means the dataset only includes the top performers rather than every single player.

This makes it impossible for two social networks that have the same pitch to co-exist and leads to pretty strong differentiation. Facebook owns relationships. Twitter owns interests. Instagram owns lifestyle. Snapchat is starting to own experience. This is why I find it fascinating when the content from one social network or medium bleeds into another. Twitter doesn’t allow for tweets longer than 140 characters so people overcome that by sharing screengrabs of long form text.</description></item><item><title>Food identification with Google's Cloud Vision</title><link>/2016/08/29/food-identification-with-googles-cloud-vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/08/29/food-identification-with-googles-cloud-vision/</guid><description>Something that I haven’t quite figured out is how to avoid wasting food.

Being a lazy engineer doing this manually became a bit tiresome so I finally automated it. Unfortunately Turo does not have a simple way of downloading the data and there’s no open API so I had to resort my usual solution: scraping. Luckily for me I just came off of updating my Yahoo fantasy football scraping script and was ready to do the same for Turo.</description></item><item><title>Integrating poorly documented Open Source libraries</title><link>/2016/08/14/integrating-poorly-documented-open-source-libraries/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/08/14/integrating-poorly-documented-open-source-libraries/</guid><description>Open source is great: if you find the right library you’re able to save a ton of time and get code that’s been through the gauntlet that you can confidently incorporate into your system. Unfortunately many open source libraries are partially baked with documentation that doesn’t always accompany the rapid development of the code. This leads developers to repeatedly cross reference their code with some archaic documentation and then wonder why it’s not working as expected.</description></item><item><title>Fantasy football stats: 2016-2017 edition</title><link>/2016/08/13/fantasy-football-stats-2016-2017-edition/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/08/13/fantasy-football-stats-2016-2017-edition/</guid><description>This is an annual tradition now but I just updated my old script that crawls and extracts the projected fantasy football data from Yahoo to work with the 2016-2017 season.

At the same time, you can’t change what you can’t measure. Combining these two makes it clear that to improve, whether people or process, you need to start measuring and tracking the appropriate metrics.
In software engineering, some things are easy to track: how many bugs there are, how quickly they’re resolved, how much code are written - but rarely tell the whole story and may lead to perverse incentives.</description></item><item><title>One of my favorite programs</title><link>/2016/08/06/one-of-my-favorite-programs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/08/06/one-of-my-favorite-programs/</guid><description>While working on a small programming puzzle I remembered Peter Norvig’s spell checker and how blown away I was after seeing it for the first.

They started with books but were able to grow into other smaller products once they figured out the logistics behind shipping smaller items.</description></item><item><title>Unbundling politics</title><link>/2016/03/27/unbundling-politics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/27/unbundling-politics/</guid><description>Yesterday I made the case that the current political system consists of a series of product bundles and I’ve been thinking of ways unbundling would work. And what better way than to look at existing products and industries that have been unbundled.
As numerous people have pointed out, the music industry is a clear example. Initially music was sold on CDs and there was no idea of buying solo songs. But with the launch of the iPod, iTunes, and internet proliferation it became possible to buy individual songs.</description></item><item><title>Political parties are product bundles</title><link>/2016/03/26/political-parties-are-product-bundles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/26/political-parties-are-product-bundles/</guid><description>I rarely write about politics but it’s an election year and I had an interesting realization. Political parties are just like product bundles. We each have our own issues and policies we’re passionate about but it’s impossible to find a politician, less a party, that has the same views we do. Instead we have political parties that take a few issues and policies and try to wrap them up in a bundle hoping to appeal to enough people to win an election.</description></item><item><title>Data analysis needs to be fun</title><link>/2016/03/21/data-analysis-needs-to-be-fun/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/21/data-analysis-needs-to-be-fun/</guid><description>In order to do any meaningful data analysis you need to have fun doing it. Otherwise it becomes a chore that’s extended by each additional analysis you run and each additional failed attempt at an insight. This requires a positive attitude and enjoying the slow, methodical process of discovery and appreciating each iteration while getting closer to the end goal. The vast majority of analyses lead to no new insight, especially when all the easy stuff has already been figured out, and it’s critical to remain the optimist while appreciating the present.</description></item><item><title>Passing the torch: IBM to Google</title><link>/2016/03/20/passing-the-torch-ibm-to-google/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/20/passing-the-torch-ibm-to-google/</guid><description>Last week the big news was that Google’s AlphaGo was able to win 4 of the 5 games against Lee Sedol in Go.

Yet I had this vague recollection of reading something that made it seem enums carried a ton of risks when changing the column definition so wanted to see if I could “break” it. Turns out it’s a lot more resilient than I thought. I went through a series of combinations - ranging from changing the order of the enums in the definition to trying to insert values that didn’t exist but in every case it handled it as expected.</description></item><item><title>Airbnb, Uber, and local laws</title><link>/2016/03/06/airbnb-uber-and-local-laws/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/03/06/airbnb-uber-and-local-laws/</guid><description>Yesterday I read an interesting piece on Airbnb in New Orleans. The content itself isn&amp;rsquo;t new - it highlights the typical conflict between those that view Airbnb as violating local ordinances and ruining the city and others who believe that Airbnb brings value and is helping New Orleans rebuild after Katrina.

Usually the prices the third parties are offering are very close to the fair market value but I wondered if there was an arbitrage opportunity by reserving a longer term instance and selling it for a series of shorter term leases. The typical discount for buying a 1 year reserved instance is 30% while buying one for 3 years can get over 60%.</description></item><item><title>Tool specialization and growing companies</title><link>/2016/02/28/tool-specialization-and-growing-companies/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/02/28/tool-specialization-and-growing-companies/</guid><description>It’s obvious in hindsight but incredible when you experience it but every successful company has to iterate through a variety of tools as it, and its problems, grow. A typical modern tech startup starts by identifying a problem and using a common web framework to quickly come up with the first pass. But as this company grows new problems and situations arise that the initial solution no longer supports.

Sometimes I’ll have to skip back or reduce it back to the normal speed but for the most part this approach saves me tons of time and I like to think that I absorb the same amount of information.

Compared to changing a database schema, changing code is trivial. The database structure defines how you think about your business and either provides the flexibility as you grow or impedes you when forced to support something it wasn’t designed to handle.
With code you can do a deploy which can replace all behavior at once while with data you’re forced to acknowledge and handle the data you have.</description></item><item><title>Longer terms in government?</title><link>/2016/02/13/longer-terms-in-government/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/02/13/longer-terms-in-government/</guid><description>Many have written about society’s inability to enact laws quickly enough to deal with the current pace of technological innovation.

Code that works perfectly in a development environment can fail catastrophically in production and cause a severe impact on the business. Issues can stem from bits of inefficient codes to database schemas that just don&amp;rsquo;t scale on production. Ideally your development environment mirrors production and has the same load and hardware but that&amp;rsquo;s rarely the case.</description></item><item><title>Jsonify.me 2.0</title><link>/2015/10/21/jsonify.me-2.0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/10/21/jsonify.me-2.0/</guid><description>A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the idea of having a “go to” project that you use to pick up a new language and earlier this week I finished the bulk of the rewrite of jsonify.me.

Getting familiar with common commands is a great way to improve your productivity and over time you amass a massive collection of scripts that allow you to do nearly everything.

Code that’s not deployed is wasted effort as well as a loss to the business. And a big part of making sure code is deployed is thinking through the deployment plan as we write the code. Some code is deployed simply by pushing the new application while other code may require updating the database schema. More complex code may depend on other applications which will need to be tweaked and deployed beforehand.</description></item><item><title>Adblock, publishers, and content quality</title><link>/2015/10/15/adblock-publishers-and-content-quality/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/10/15/adblock-publishers-and-content-quality/</guid><description>Ever since the release of iOS 9 and it’s support for adblocking apps I can’t go a day without seeing some article about adblock.

Normally, implementing a site search requires a backend to accept queries, break them down into the appropriate keywords, and hit a search index to find the matching documents.</description></item><item><title>Debate what's necessary and no more</title><link>/2015/08/03/debate-whats-necessary-and-no-more/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/08/03/debate-whats-necessary-and-no-more/</guid><description>A critical component in communicating between various teams is knowing who has what responsibility.

Coming from a traditional object oriented background it’s typical to define an interface that defines a few method signatures and then explicitly implement that interface in a new class. Below’s a trivial example of this approach in Java:

Rather than relying on outdated documentation or discovering undocumented features the database is the actual source of truth and defines both the limits and the capabilities of the application.

It’s definitely more difficult to get up to speed on a database rather than documentation or a demo of the UI but the knowledge gained is significantly deeper.</description></item><item><title>Tunnel vision</title><link>/2015/07/20/tunnel-vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/07/20/tunnel-vision/</guid><description>A common behavior when solving a coding problem is focusing too much on the solution and not enough on the general context.

I tried doing the same with Google Sheets and it works for smaller tables but as soon as you get tables with thousands of rows it’s noticeably slower than Excel.</description></item><item><title>A Bloom filter in my head</title><link>/2015/07/16/a-bloom-filter-in-my-head/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/07/16/a-bloom-filter-in-my-head/</guid><description>As many at TripleLift will tell you I have a fondness for Bloom filters but only recently did I realize that our brains work in a similar way. We don’t always know every particular detail or have perfect recall but what we do have is the ability to realize that something is familiar and that we might have encountered it before. This triggers enough additional thoughts that we’re able to dig up the actual thought or reference.</description></item><item><title>Comparing SQL schemas</title><link>/2015/07/12/comparing-sql-schemas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/07/12/comparing-sql-schemas/</guid><description>During development it’s common to get your dev database out of sync with the one in production. Sometimes it’s due to an additional column in development you added before realizing it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary and other times it’s just creating a few temporary tables on production that you forget to drop. In both cases it’s useful to reconcile the schema differences every once in a while to keep your database in a clean state.</description></item><item><title>Apple and Intel</title><link>/2015/07/08/apple-and-intel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/07/08/apple-and-intel/</guid><description>I recently finished The Intel Trinity which detailed the history of Intel and its rise from a small memory manufacturer to the leader in microprocessors. The entire book is worth a read if you’re interested in startups and the rise of Silicon Valley but one anecdote that immediately stood out was about the reason Apple didn’t use Intel chips until 2005.

The core functionality is unchanged but they used a clever solution to make it easier to add, modify, and remove endpoints. By coming up with a standardized representation for each of the endpoints they’re able to write wrappers in different languages that generate the API calls programmatically. For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve included a subset of the EC2 definition below. It contains the information necessary to programatically generate the API wrapper to hit the appropriate EC2 endpoints.</description></item><item><title>Properly handling text based two factor authentication</title><link>/2015/06/20/properly-handling-text-based-two-factor-authentication/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/06/20/properly-handling-text-based-two-factor-authentication/</guid><description>The purpose of two factor authentication is to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts by requiring a device other than a password to verify that it’s actually you.

It’s one thing to be abstractly aware of Moore’s Law but shocking to actually see it.

Ideally, you’d want to add this column before or after another one that makes sense rather than all the way at the end.

PostgreSQL and Redshift make this difficult since all new columns are automatically added at the end.</description></item><item><title>Don't scrape into a Dropbox folder</title><link>/2015/04/19/dont-scrape-into-a-dropbox-folder/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/04/19/dont-scrape-into-a-dropbox-folder/</guid><description>Thursday night I kicked off a data scraping project for a friend.

Conventions range from having a standard way of declaring variables to the way files are organized within a project to the field names in database tables. The obvious benefit is that your code becomes significantly easier to navigate, both to you as well as to others on the team, since you don’t have to run through a series of searches trying to figure out whether a variable is called myVariable, MyVariable, or my_variable.</description></item><item><title>Learning to spell again</title><link>/2015/03/15/learning-to-spell-again/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/03/15/learning-to-spell-again/</guid><description>I recently discovered that I’m a much worse speller than I used to be.

Understanding how these various components fit together allow you to make smarter decisions and provide the tools to test and verify your code.</description></item><item><title>Lessons from Node</title><link>/2015/02/22/lessons-from-node/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/02/22/lessons-from-node/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move on from Node after messing around with it for the past couple of months. And while the experience is still fresh I wanted to share my thoughts. I’m far from an expert so take all these with a grain of salt.
Node’s powerful and in the right hands can make a developer extremely productive. I was able to write a few simple applications surprisingly quickly given my limited knowledge and I can see why so many opt to use it.</description></item><item><title>Smarterphones</title><link>/2015/02/16/smarterphones/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/02/16/smarterphones/</guid><description>Yesterday I got a reminder of how deep smartphones and tech companies have gotten into our lives. After spending a day volunteering at the C4Q office, I got a text from my wife asking me where I was. When I opened the Hangouts app I saw an option to share my current location. This is the first time I’ve seen a contextual behavior in Hangouts. I’ve seen it before in other apps - a Gmail alert telling me I forgot to attach a file when the text has “please find attached” or Google Calendar defaulting to a weekly repetition if I put “weekly” in the meeting title - but this is the first time I’ve seen it happen in Hangouts.</description></item><item><title>Learning Scala</title><link>/2015/02/13/learning-scala/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/02/13/learning-scala/</guid><description>Over the past week I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning Scala. The initial motivation was that our API code is in PHP and in dire need of a rewrite. And since we&amp;rsquo;ve been rewriting our other critical applications in Java we want to leverage the JVM as much as possible. At the same time, we want to keep the code simple, expressive, and maintable while being fun and easy to write. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard great things about Scala so decided to give it a shot.</description></item><item><title>URL redirection app</title><link>/2015/02/07/url-redirection-app/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/02/07/url-redirection-app/</guid><description>At TripleLift, we’re big fans of the Switcheroo plugin and rely on it during development to test new versions of our code. It allows us to override a production hostname with one of our development boxes so we can see how our code works on a live site. So if a production site is referencing a JavaScript file at http://production-environment/script.js we use Switcheroo to have it reference the development file at http://dev-environment/script.</description></item><item><title>MySQL vs PostgreSQL sort order</title><link>/2015/02/01/mysql-vs-postgresql-sort-order/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/02/01/mysql-vs-postgresql-sort-order/</guid><description>At TripleLift, we have a migrations job that copies aggregate data from Redshift to MySQL so it can be accessed along the rest of the transactional data. As part of a test, I tried comparing that the data matched exactly but ran into an issue when exporting the data to select. Namely, to make the comparison as simple as possible I wanted to run the same select query in both tables and compare the results.</description></item><item><title>Migrating a simple HTTP application on AWS</title><link>/2015/01/29/migrating-a-simple-http-application-on-aws/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/01/29/migrating-a-simple-http-application-on-aws/</guid><description>A fun little exercise I had to do was rewrite a simple application from Node.js to Netty to fit into the rest of our stack. The rewrite took a couple of days but the deployment and testing was critical to get right so I wanted to share our approach. To provide some context, the application was an HTTP server that handled ~1,000 requests a minute with each request spawning at most three more to pull in more data.</description></item><item><title>IBM's rumored layoff</title><link>/2015/01/26/ibms-rumored-layoff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/01/26/ibms-rumored-layoff/</guid><description>Given the rumor of the massive IBM layoffs I decided to pull some others and see how it compared. Surprisingly, the next highest was also at IBM - but in 1993. On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s odd to see this pattern as if they&amp;rsquo;ve learned nothing. On the other, it&amp;rsquo;s a sign that they acknowledge the problem and are willing to adapt. Since the 1993 layoff IBM&amp;rsquo;s stock price increased over 950% and this round may provide another burst.</description></item><item><title>The changing fidelity of the past</title><link>/2015/01/25/the-changing-fidelity-of-the-past/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/01/25/the-changing-fidelity-of-the-past/</guid><description>A fun exercise is picking a random day in the past and trying to recreate it using the various tools at our disposal. In my case the most useful ones are my calendars, both personal and work, the photos I took, and Foursquare/Swarm. As long as I was vigilant in documenting the events it’s simple to figure out what I did. We lose a bit of the mystery when we document our lives and we no longer have long discussions trying to recreate events with friends.</description></item><item><title>Don't trust client side data</title><link>/2015/01/24/dont-trust-client-side-data/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/01/24/dont-trust-client-side-data/</guid><description>At TripleLift, we collect a variety of data - some on the client side and some on the server side. One thing we’ve learned is that you should never trust or make assumptions about client data, no matter how great your JavaScript is. You will always see odd data coming in and your data processing pipeline needs to be designed to take this into account. In our case, one of our jobs assumed (and the client side code confirmed) that particular events would be unique - this allowed us to write a much simpler query without having to worry about many to many joins.</description></item><item><title>Fun with GitHub's map tools</title><link>/2015/01/18/fun-with-githubs-map-tools/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/01/18/fun-with-githubs-map-tools/</guid><description>After discovering GitHub&amp;rsquo;s map visualization feature I needed to give it a shot on the only GPS dataset I had available, my runs from RunKeeper. Unfortunately, the RunKeeper files were in GPX while GitHub expects either geoson or topjson. A short Python script later and I was able to convert the GPX data into geojson.

On one hand, having many languages provides flexibility in choosing the right language for the job and allows engineers to learn and explore new tools. Better habits are encouraged since the interface between components requires a well structured and tested structure rather than relying on code similarity.</description></item><item><title>Some quick Twitter analytics analysis</title><link>/2015/01/06/some-quick-twitter-analytics-analysis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/01/06/some-quick-twitter-analytics-analysis/</guid><description>I finally got around to exploring the Twitter analytics data and wanted to see whether I could find anything useful.

Earlier this week I set up Amazon’s Fire TV Stick and wanted to jot down some thoughts while they’re still fresh. For the $20 promotion price, it’s a great deal.

This happened throughout college on difficult problem sets as well as countless engineering projects at work. Sometimes instead of getting hung up on a tough problem the best thing to do is to forget about it and go for a walk and let the subconscious take over. I don’t know why this works but it seems to be common with others as well.</description></item><item><title>Travel to appreciate technological growth</title><link>/2014/12/13/travel-to-appreciate-technological-growth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/12/13/travel-to-appreciate-technological-growth/</guid><description>If you’re constantly watching something grow it’s hard to notice the magnitude while those further away see it immediately. This is well known for parents not seeing how quickly their children are growing but obvious for distant relatives and friends who get a glimpse once every few months.
I have the same relationship with technology. I’m surrounded by it each day that it’s hard to tell how much it’s changed but a way to combat this bias is by traveling, especially to developing countries.</description></item><item><title>Piketty and the power of data</title><link>/2014/12/09/piketty-and-the-power-of-data/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/12/09/piketty-and-the-power-of-data/</guid><description>I read Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century a couple of months ago but have only organized my notes and thoughts now. It’s a simple, enjoyable read that provides an overview of the modern western economies and offers a compelling explanation of how wealth and income equality occur.

The most actionable insight was to start thinking in terms of “symptom-based monitoring” where the alerts should reflect what the users are experiencing rather than various issues along the tech stack. This aligns your alerts with user expectations and can also simplify alerting since they will all be running at a high level.</description></item><item><title>AWS: Always shipping</title><link>/2014/11/24/aws-always-shipping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/11/24/aws-always-shipping/</guid><description>I never thought about this until Shaun brought it up but now I see it all the time: AWS ships code quicker than any other company that size.

So many startups strive to get an investment and believe that once they raise a round everything will get easier. That’s when things get difficult. Instead of focusing on achieving product market fit you start worrying about market share, competition, company culture, recruiting, process, which require a completely different skillset than what you started with.

I decided to do replicate the exercise using Android and Swype. Some are similar while others are completely different. I suspect a big part of the difference is that Swype uses my history when offering the suggestions and since I’ve been travelling recently many of them tend to be airport related.

Whenever I’m in an app and click on a web link it would immediately open up that page in a browser window. And when I’m already in a mobile browser and click on a link it would open that page up in a new tab. Compare this with the desktop environment. Clicking on a link within an app does open up a new browser window immediately but since there are shortcuts to quickly switch between programs it’s not a huge deal.</description></item><item><title>Dev tools matter</title><link>/2014/09/25/dev-tools-matter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/09/25/dev-tools-matter/</guid><description>It’s amazing the impact tools have on productivity and enjoyment.

Some approach problems top down and will stub out the entire solution using dummy values and methods and come up with a naive solution before fleshing everything out properly. Others will instead take a bottom up approach and try to complete each method entirely before moving on to the next one.
Especially for larger problems, I prefer the top down approach. By stubbing out the various pieces it’s easy to see how everything fits together and makes it easy to identify and solve potential issues before investing a ton of effort into a poor implementation.</description></item><item><title>Curated Twitter timelines and the tech stack</title><link>/2014/09/08/curated-twitter-timelines-and-the-tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/09/08/curated-twitter-timelines-and-the-tech-stack/</guid><description>Apparently Twitter is considering curation user’s timelines. A perspective people haven’t really discussed is the impact on the tech side. Right now each user has a unique timeline that needs to be presented in near-real time in case they need to see it. This results in a massive storage operation using Redis where these timelines are continuously generated and cached. By moving to a model where every user can be categorized into a group that sees a particular set of tweets Twitter can drastically reduce the amount of data they need to store per user.</description></item><item><title>Importance of various tech services</title><link>/2014/09/07/importance-of-various-tech-services/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/09/07/importance-of-various-tech-services/</guid><description>A recent article on our attachment to social media got me thinking about my most commonly used services and their relative importance. The goal is to answer the question of how I’d feel if various services suddenly disappeared.

The primary reason is that you will typically have different settings between a production and development environment and but at the same time will have a lot of options shared between them. A production environment will typically be more restrictive and optimized for performance whereas a development environment will be setup to provide as much debug information as possible.</description></item><item><title>Yahoo fantasy football stats - 2014 edition</title><link>/2014/08/26/yahoo-fantasy-football-stats-2014-edition/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/08/26/yahoo-fantasy-football-stats-2014-edition/</guid><description>This might be too late for some but I dug up my Yahoo fantasy football stats scraper from last year and updated it to work for the 2014 season. The old version used the great Scrapy framework but unfortunately Yahoo changed something on their end that made the login spoofing too difficult to do via a backend script.

If you log in to one of your EC2 instance and make a simple request to http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id you will get back the id of that instance. Similarly, you can get all sorts of other instance information, including the public hostname, the instance region, and instance type.

The idea was was consumers would benefit from being able to get items that are custom made and can be customized to fit individual styles while supporting a local business and makers would have a new avenue to sell their products and build their brand.</description></item><item><title>Logging in through your inbox</title><link>/2014/05/20/logging-in-through-your-inbox/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/05/20/logging-in-through-your-inbox/</guid><description>MixPanel has a clever way of handling failed login attempts. Instead of locking the user out of the account or forcing a password reset they send an email with two links - one to log in to the account directly and another to reset the password. I don’t recall ever seeing this approach before and wish more sites started doing it. This approach also obviates the need to even have a password - a site can just send a “login link” for an entered email address and the user can login via their inbox.</description></item><item><title>Examining ssh login requests</title><link>/2014/05/16/examining-ssh-login-requests/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/05/16/examining-ssh-login-requests/</guid><description>I recently migrated to Digital Ocean and spent some time beefing up its security.

The thesis being that only humans are creative enough (right now at least) to develop new skills and processes to deal with production inefficiencies. This rings true - in order to improve a manufacturing system you need to understand the entire process, from the raw ingredients up to the way consumers end up using the product. It&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to do these days as products become more complicated with an increasing number of specialized components and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see companies taking a longer term view and focusing on the value of human creativity rather than short term cost cutting.</description></item><item><title>Craigslist: the web's fertilizer</title><link>/2014/04/25/craigslist-the-webs-fertilizer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/04/25/craigslist-the-webs-fertilizer/</guid><description>Craigslist has become the fertilizer of the web.

Tightly coupled systems scare me. They will undoubtedly break and bring down big chunks of your infrastructure. The solution is to think about your system in terms of various independent services that are responsible for only doing a few things well that won’t bring down the rest of the system if they fail. This approach makes it easier to maintain your code as it grows and also reduces the risk of massive failure.</description></item><item><title>Some computer memories</title><link>/2014/04/13/some-computer-memories/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/04/13/some-computer-memories/</guid><description>Inspired by yesterday’s post I decided to compile a list the memories I’ve had growing up with computers - hopefully they spark others.

I suspect Uber’s already done as much as it can on the messaging side; psychologically it’s just tough for someone to take a $10 ride one day and then a day later pay an order of magnitude more.</description></item><item><title>Visualizing RunKeeper data in R</title><link>/2014/01/04/visualizing-runkeeper-data-in-r/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/01/04/visualizing-runkeeper-data-in-r/</guid><description>What better way to celebrate running 1000 miles in 2013 than dumping the data into R and generating some visualizations?

In Mumbai, the rate starts at 19 rupees (~32 cents) and includes the first 1.</description></item><item><title>Smartphones and literacy</title><link>/2013/12/26/smartphones-and-literacy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/12/26/smartphones-and-literacy/</guid><description>Source: Business Insider
In 2012 global smartphone ownership surpassed PC ownership and smartphones are still seeing massive growth. The obvious consequence is that many people who’ve never owned a computer are starting to own smartphones and that’s having a huge impact on the world. Almost everything will be affected - not just technology but also business, politics, and general culture. As these smartphones get more powerful and pervasive we’ll see applications that we can’t even imagine right now.</description></item><item><title>Global products</title><link>/2013/12/25/global-products/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/12/25/global-products/</guid><description>The trip to India got me thinking about “global products” that work the same wherever they are. It’s surprisingly difficult to find tech products that fit this description. Cell phones will almost always work internationally but roaming charges make it impractical. Having an unlocked phone helps but you still need to get a SIM card which is a hassle in many countries.
Even something as standard as a laptop isn’t as easy to use as it should be.</description></item><item><title>Getting a SIM card in India</title><link>/2013/12/23/getting-a-sim-card-in-india/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/12/23/getting-a-sim-card-in-india/</guid><description>I’ve heard about the wonders of an unlocked phone and decided to try it out during my recent trip to India.

Instead of building a UX designed to handle bulk operations and complicated workflows you build support for file uploads and handle the business logic entirely on the backend. The motivation is that it’s extremely difficult to build a UI that’s going to be as powerful and flexible as a simple CSV file, especially when outside tools, such as Excel, can help generate these files.</description></item><item><title>Why Bank of America, why?</title><link>/2013/12/20/why-bank-of-america-why/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/12/20/why-bank-of-america-why/</guid><description>Before leaving for a trip to India, I wanted to make sure that I’d be allowed to access the ATM so I decided to contact my bank.

For most of human history, people either made what they needed on their own or traded with a local craftsman. Over time, this led to a specialization in skills and also the rise of the apprenticeship model. Since trade was mostly local, it was difficult to build a large business and most businesses were family run with parents passing down skills to their children.</description></item><item><title>Run Django under Nginx, Virtualenv and Supervisor</title><link>/2013/07/30/run-django-under-nginx-virtualenv-and-supervisor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/07/30/run-django-under-nginx-virtualenv-and-supervisor/</guid><description>After yet another attempt to deploy a Django application I decided to document the steps required to get everything up and running.

Prolog is pretty different than the mainstream programming languages, it belongs to the logic programming language category and relies on defining a variety of relations and then querying these relationships to get results.</description></item><item><title>Citibike Directions: Second Attempt</title><link>/2013/06/04/citibike-directions-second-attempt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/06/04/citibike-directions-second-attempt/</guid><description>To coincide with the launch of Citibike, I wrote a simple web app that provided cycling directions from one Citibike station to another.

Meanwhile, Phil Porter, who had worked with [Richard] Frenkiel on the original system, came up with a permanent answer to an interesting question. Should a cellular phone have a dial tone? Porter made a radical suggestion that it shouldn’t. A caller should dial a number and then push “send.” That way, the mobile caller would be less rushed; also, the call would be connected for a shorter time, thus putting less strain on the network.</description></item><item><title>Raspbmc</title><link>/2013/04/10/raspbmc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/04/10/raspbmc/</guid><description>I’ve been interested in the Raspberry Pi ever since I first saw it mentioned in the tech news and finally got to play with it over the past few days when my brother (thanks Simon!) lent me an extra one he had.

These high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) free sodas are extremely popular and people stock up while they can. I don’t know whether this is due to the better taste, the nostalgia, or the limited supply but these sugar based versions are definitely more popular. I wonder what would happen if either Coke or Pepsi decided to go “all in” on sugar and launch a marketing campaign against HFCS based food and drinks.</description></item><item><title>The new Gmail compose</title><link>/2013/04/02/the-new-gmail-compose/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/04/02/the-new-gmail-compose/</guid><description>A few days ago, Google made the new compose default on Gmail. It went from a separate page to a popup that’s accessible from anywhere in Gmail. And for the vast majority of the time, it’s better: it’s quicker to get to and makes it easy to reference other emails while writing a new one. Unfortunately, for attaching an image (not embedding it inline) or doing some heavy formatting, it’s a huge step backwards and makes me want the old compose back.</description></item><item><title>Mailbox: Is the server required?</title><link>/2013/03/29/mailbox-is-the-server-required/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/03/29/mailbox-is-the-server-required/</guid><description>After a couple of weeks on the waiting list I finally got access to the Mailbox App. It’s a huge improvement over the standard mail app and my mobile email consumption habits have improved significantly.

My first distinct memory of seeing it is from Karma but I’ve started noticing it everywhere. It runs the gamut from non-profit causes to video game PR firms. In fact, we’re even using this approach for the Makers Alley homepage.
Surprisingly, it’s starting to make inroads on news sites as well. Whereas before news sites would have an article spread across 20 pages (looking at you Business Insider) in order to increase page views and show more ads, some news outlets are actually improving the user experience.</description></item><item><title>Email addresses are private?</title><link>/2013/03/24/email-addresses-are-private/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/03/24/email-addresses-are-private/</guid><description>Last week, Andrew “weev” Aurenheimer, was sentenced to 41 months for going through publicly accessible AT&amp;amp;T URLs which exposed the email address of 114,000 iPad owners.

The benefits were obvious:
Cost: S3 is cheaper than EC2. Reliable: S3 doesn’t go down near as frequently as EC2. Scalable: Since it’s primarily static you don’t have to worry about additional capacity or dealing with caching, databases, and all the other fun things.</description></item><item><title>Just do the work</title><link>/2013/03/09/just-do-the-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/03/09/just-do-the-work/</guid><description>Entrepreneurs are familiar with the elevator pitch. The idea is to give a pitch in 30 seconds (the duration of an elevator ride) that is compelling enough to an investor that it leads to a follow up meeting where you can go through your pitch deck.

People who need to send something urgently can pay more than a dollar while others who only care that the letter arrives can pay 20 cents.</description></item><item><title>App Store, what took so long?</title><link>/2013/03/01/app-store-what-took-so-long/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/03/01/app-store-what-took-so-long/</guid><description>In old versions of the iOS App Store, every time you downloaded a new app it would close the App Store and navigate to the screen with the now-downloading app. Recent versions of the App Store keep it open and force you explicitly exit.

Newegg recently defended itself against a patent troll that sued them over a shopping cart patent. As a result, the patent was invalidated and Soverain Software will lose $2.5M from this and the $18M they won in 2011 from Victoria’s Secret and Avon. Unfortunately, they’ll still keep the tens of millions of dollars they “earned” in earlier years. Since virtually every ecommerce site has a shopping cart feature you’d think that this patent would have been invalidated sooner.</description></item><item><title>Blog updates since November</title><link>/2013/01/24/blog-updates-since-november/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/01/24/blog-updates-since-november/</guid><description>In November, I migrated my Tumblr and Wordpress blogs over to GitHub pages and have been making a few tweaks here and there.

Turns out that they are noticeably different: IE is on a linear decline with close to 70% in Q3 2008 but around 36% in Q1 2012 while RIM starts at 16% in Q3 2008, goes up to a high of 21% in 2009 and then drops to 7% in Q1 2012.</description></item><item><title>Photo taken near Times Square</title><link>/2012/07/09/photo-taken-near-times-square/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/07/09/photo-taken-near-times-square/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Achieving browser autocomplete</title><link>/2012/06/07/achieving-browser-autocomplete/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/06/07/achieving-browser-autocomplete/</guid><description>Over the past few days, I’ve been thinking about habits.

The problem is that I think I know how to pronounce them so when I use them for the first time in conversation, or hear someone using them, some confusion arises (as well as making me look like a fool).
I am not sure if this is isolated to me or society as a whole.</description></item><item><title>On Microsoft walking away from Yahoo</title><link>/2008/05/04/on-microsoft-walking-away-from-yahoo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/05/04/on-microsoft-walking-away-from-yahoo/</guid><description>A little unexpected but I think this was the right decision for Microsoft for a couple of reasons:
Jerry Yang was doing everything in his power to prevent MS from acquiring Yahoo - what type of message does that send and how must the employees of Yahoo feel if their CEO is acting this way. In order to compete with Google, the merger must have gotten done quickly and smoothly, this would not have been the case in the case of a hostile takeover.</description></item><item><title>The homeless in the US</title><link>/2008/05/04/the-homeless-in-the-us/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/05/04/the-homeless-in-the-us/</guid><description>I find it absurd that the average prisoner costs $25,000 a year to keep in prison ($75,000 for death row) and yet we still have homelessness in the United States. Each one of the homeless may start committing some type of crime in order to get into prison and at least not worry about where their next meal comes from yet they are staying on the streets as free men. Isn&amp;rsquo;t there something we can do to encourage good behavior instead of encouraging bad behavior?</description></item><item><title>Video games as art</title><link>/2008/04/29/video-games-as-art/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/04/29/video-games-as-art/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s about time video games are considered an art. They are creative endeavors that take as much and as long to make as some movies. There is also a huge distinction between the great and the poor games. Games these days can be considered movies and they should be treated in the same way.
Maybe then will video games no longer be the black sheep of the media and entertainment business.</description></item><item><title>Why does EA want Take Two?</title><link>/2008/04/29/why-does-ea-want-take-two/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/04/29/why-does-ea-want-take-two/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why no one is pointing this out but it seems that as soon as EA acquires T2, the T2 folks would just leave to create a new studio. They seem independent and I doubt that they&amp;rsquo;d want to work for EA. And although EA would get the rights to all of the T2 games and may try to develop the series, they might not have the imagination or the guys to do it.</description></item><item><title>On Apple buying PA Semiconductor</title><link>/2008/04/25/on-apple-buying-pa-semiconductor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/04/25/on-apple-buying-pa-semiconductor/</guid><description>This post is a response to Robert Cringely&amp;rsquo;s PBS Post. He&amp;rsquo;s giving 2 reasons for the acquisition and I wanted to add to two of his points.
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The short term reason is to force Intel to give Apple price cuts for fear that Apple will make their own chips: I do not think that Intel needs to worry about Apple manufacturing their own PC chips as Apple already went through that phase and AMD already provides the necessary pressure on Intel to lower their prices.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Currently lead the engineering team at TripleLift.
